25588157,"Work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general health of nurses.","Gaps in research focusing on work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general health of nurses is evident within developing contexts like South Africa. This study identified the relationship between work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general health of nurses. A total of 1200 nurses from four hospitals were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study (75% response rate). Participants completed five questionnaires and multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine significant relationships between variables. Staff issues are best associated with burnout as well as job satisfaction. Burnout explained the highest amount of variance in mental health of nurses. These are known to compromise productivity and performance, as well as affect the quality of patient care. Issues, such as security risks in the workplace, affect job satisfaction and health of nurses. Although this is more salient to developing contexts it is important in developing strategies and intervention programs towards improving nurse and patient related outcomes.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiologypsychology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursespsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'South Africaepidemiology', 'Stress, Psychologicalepidemiologypsychology', 'Young Adult']",[],Journal Article
34018959,Burnout among healthcare providers during COVID-19: Challenges and evidence-based interventions.,"Burnout is a major occupational problem among healthcare providers, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. The frontline health workforce is experiencing a high workload and multiple psychosocial stressors which may affect their mental and emotional health, leading to burnout symptoms. Moreover, sleep deprivation and a critical lack of psychosocial support may aggravate such symptoms amidst Covid-19. From an ethical viewpoint, healthcare providers may experience moral distress while safeguarding patient welfare and autonomy. Moreover, social injustice and structural inequities may affect their emotional health while tackling a high volume of new cases and mortality. Global evidence indicates the need for adopting multipronged evidence-based approaches to address burnout during this pandemic, which may include increasing the awareness of work-related stress and burnout, promoting mindfulness and self-care practices for promoting mental wellbeing, ensuring optimal mental health services, using digital technologies to address workplace stress and deliver mental health interventions, and improving organisational policies and practices focusing on burnout among healthcare providers.","['Burnout, Psychologicalepidemiologyprevention & control', 'COVID-19psychology', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'SARS-CoV-2']",[],Journal Article
31532693,The Psychosocial Implications of Sport Specialization in Pediatric Athletes.,"Data on the psychosocial implications of sport specialization in pediatric athletes are lacking. Sport specialization often requires increased training hours and may predispose young athletes to social isolation, poor academic performance, increased anxiety, greater stress, inadequate sleep, decreased family time, and burnout. Sport specialization frequently introduces multiple stressors that could be expected to adversely affect mental health and function in young athletes and may increase the risk for burnout. This may be confounded by altered sleep duration and quality, increased drive for elite status, and perfectionistic personality types. The signs and symptoms of burnout in young athletes can be difficult to detect. It is important to be aware of the possible diagnosis of burnout in young athletes who display vague symptoms and a decrease in academic performance. The purpose of this review was to survey the available literature on sport specialization in young athletes and its association with mental health, sleep, the drive for success in sport, and burnout.","['Academic Performancepsychology', 'Adolescent', 'Athletespsychology', 'Burnout, Psychologicaletiologyprevention & controlpsychology', 'Child', 'Drive', 'Humans', 'Risk Factors', 'Sleep Hygiene', 'Specialization', 'Youth Sportspsychology']","['burnout', 'mental health', 'sport psychology', 'youth athletes']",Review
30927579,Brief mindfulness-based stress management program for a better mental state in working populations - Happy Nurse Project: A randomized controlled trial(✰✰).,"The efficacy of the mindfulness-based stress management program for maintaining a better mental state has not been examined among working populations. We aimed to explore the effectiveness of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program for hospital nurses. In a multi-center randomized trial, 80 junior nurses working in hospitals were randomly allocated either to the brief mindfulness-based stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet. The program consisted of four 30 min individual sessions conducted by trained senior nurses using a detailed manual. The primary outcome was the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at week 26. Secondary outcomes included presence of a major depressive episode; severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and presenteeism; utility scores; and adverse events up to 52 weeks. The mean HADS score of all the participants at baseline was 7.2. At 26 weeks, adjusted mean scores on the HADS score were 7.2 (95% confidence intervals: 5.9, 8. 5) in the program group and 6.0 (4.8, 7.2) in the leaflet group, respectively. The coefficient of the group by time interaction was not statistically significant at -1.41 (-3.35, 0.54; P = 0.156). No significant superiority or inferiority was observed on the other outcomes. We did not manage to recruit the number of participants we initially set out, although our post-hoc analyses showed that this did not lead to changes in our conclusions. The additive value of the brief mindfulness-based stress management program was not confirmed in mental state and self-evaluated work efficiency.","['Adult', 'Anxietyepidemiologypsychology', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiologypsychology', 'Depressionepidemiologypsychology', 'Depressive Disorder, Majorepidemiologypsychology', 'Female', 'Happiness', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mindfulnessmethods', 'Nursing Staff, Hospitalpsychology', 'Occupational Diseasesepidemiologypsychologytherapy', 'Occupational Stresspsychologytherapy', 'Patient Education as Topicmethods', 'Presenteeismstatistics & numerical data', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disordersepidemiologypsychology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']","['Anxiety', 'Behavior therapy', 'Depression', 'Mindfulness', 'Prevention and control']",Randomized Controlled Trial
29650472,Could exercise improve mental health and cognitive skills for surgeons and other healthcare professionals?,"Workplace-related illness is common in the UK, and in healthcare more than five million working days over 10years have been lost as a result. Occupational stress is well known and can affect clinicians at any stage, yet many healthcare professionals continue to work with this or other psychological problems (including anxiety, chronic fatigue, and burnout) as they do not wish to let their colleagues down. Mental health issues might be dismissed, particularly in surgery, because there is a misconception that surgeons can cope better with stress than those working in other specialties, and are better protected from clinical burnout. The benefit of exercise on physical health is clear, but its role in the maintenance of good mental health and well-being should not be underestimated. As society adopts an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, exercise for many has a lower priority than other activities. In this article we give an overview of the mental health issues that might affect doctors and surgeons, and explore how exercise can benefit our well-being and clinical performance.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Cognition', 'Exercise', 'Fatigueprevention & control', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseasesprevention & control', 'Physicianspsychology', 'Sedentary Behavior', 'Stress, Psychologicalprevention & control', 'Surgeonspsychology', 'United Kingdom']","['Exercise', 'burnout', 'clinical performance', 'healthcare', 'human factors', 'mental health']",Review
28780213,Effectiveness of Mindfulness Intervention in Reducing Stress and Burnout for Mental Health Professionals in Singapore.,"Stress and burnout have been shown to be a concern among mental health professionals in several countries including Singapore, and can affect quality of care and staff turnover. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness program in increasing mindfulness and compassion, and reducing stress and burnout, among mental health professionals in Singapore. The study utilized data from a prospective pre-post study design with follow-up. A total of 37 mental health professionals participated in the program, which was conducted in three cohorts over nine months. The program consisted of six, two-hour sessions offered once a week over six weeks, and used a range of mindfulness techniques to teach participants to cultivate compassionate and non-judgemental attitudes toward their inner experiences. Data were collected at three stages: pre- and post-intervention, and three months follow-up. Assessments considered mindfulness (five facets mindfulness questionnaire), compassion (self-compassion scale-SF and compassion scale), stress (perceived stress scale-10), and burnout (Oldenburg Burnout inventory). Participants demonstrated significant improvement in four of the five mindfulness facets (observe, describe, non-judge, and non-react) and in compassion levels, and a significant reduction in stress, following intervention. The gains in mindfulness and self-compassion scores were maintained at three months follow-up. No change was observed for burnout variables. Results suggest that mindfulness training was effective in reducing stress and improving mindfulness and compassion, but not decreasing burnout, for this group of mental health professionals in Singapore. Future experimental research with larger samples is warranted to validate the findings of the present study.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meditationpsychology', 'Mental Health Services', 'Middle Aged', 'Mindfulnessmethods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Singapore', 'Stress, Psychologicalprevention & control']","['Singapore', 'burnout', 'mental health professionals', 'mindfulness', 'stress']",Journal Article
37068141,,"Since NICE guideline PH22 Mental wellbeing at work was published in 2009, the nature of the workforce has changed in the UK. Increasing amounts of employees are on part-time, temporary or zero-hours contracts. The variations between workplaces and differences in the nature of employment are important to consider when looking at approaches to improve and protect employee mental wellbeing. Since 2009 there has been increasing recognition of mental wellbeing and how it is associated with the workplace and work outcomes. Experiences in the workplace can affect mental wellbeing positively and negatively. Good employee mental wellbeing is positive for employees and their employers. For example, better mental wellbeing and job satisfaction are associated with increased workplace performance and productivity. Poorer mental wellbeing however is associated with increased absenteeism and presenteeism and lost output costs the economy upwards of £74 billion annually. It is therefore important to implement interventions in the workplace to promote and improve mental wellbeing, and to prevent poor mental wellbeing amongst the workforce. Organisational-level approaches are important for preventing poor mental wellbeing, as well as promoting and improving mental wellbeing in the workplace. In addition, access to universal interventions at an individual level may be appropriate to help employees manage stress, prevent burnout, and build resilience, by providing skills to manage emotions, providing skills to manage situations, and through physical approaches.",[],[],Review
35023499,THE INFLUENCE OF OCCUPATIONAL STRESS ON EMPLOYEES' MENTAL HEALTH.,"The aim: To identify the features of the influence of occupational stress on occupation-specific indicators of employees' mental health. Materials and methods: In total, 771 skilled Russian-speaking respondents (226 men, 545 women; aged 18-67 years, M = 32.32 ± 12.28 years) from different countries and representing various professions participated in a remote online survey. Occupational stress intensity was assessed using the Russian adaptations of the Organizational Constraints Scale, Quantitative Workload Inventory and Aggressive Experiences Scale. Occupation-specific indicators of employees' mental health were assessed using the Russian adaptations of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Withdrawal Scale and Negative Affect at Work Scale. Results: The results showed a significant negative influence of occupational stress on occupation-specific indicators of employees' mental health. All three indicators of occupational stress showed strong significant correlations (p < .001; r = .16-.60) with all five occupation-specific indicators of negative mental health. Constraints on performance at work had the greatest negative influence on employees' mental health, followed by aggressive experiences and workload. Constraints on performance at work caused withdrawal behaviors and workload caused emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and withdrawal behaviors in men significantly more often than in women. Aggressive experiences caused depersonalization and negative affect at work in women significantly more often than in men. Conclusions: Occupational stress had a significant negative influence on all occupation-specific indicators of employees' mental health. This influence had pronounced gendered characteristics. These results convincingly demonstrate the need for effective measures to prevent occupational stress.","['Burnout, Professionalepidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Occupational Health', 'Occupational Stressepidemiology', 'Stress, Psychologicalepidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","[' aggressive experiences', ' burnout', ' hardiness', ' mental health', ' withdrawal behaviours', ' workload']",Journal Article
35760197,Relationship between burnout and Major Depressive Disorder in health professionals: A HEAR report.,"Burnout is a ""normal"" albeit concerning response to workplace stress, whereas Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious illness associated with impairment and suicide risk. Because of symptomatic overlap between the two conditions and MDD-associated stigma, individuals reporting work-related stress and depression often are ""diagnosed"" with burnout at the expense of recognizing and treating MDD. Our study aimed to leverage organizational implementation of the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention's Interactive Screening Program to elucidate relationships among burnout, depression, and other suicide risk factors. 2281 of about 30,000 (~7.6 %) medical trainees, staff, and faculty responded to an anonymous online stress and depression questionnaire. Respondents were grouped into four cohorts: screened positive for burnout alone (n = 439, 19 %), depression alone (n = 268, 12 %), both conditions (n = 759, 33 %), or neither condition (n = 817, 36 %), and compared on multiple measures of distress and other suicide risk factors. Burnout alone and depression alone each predicted greater distress and suicide risk compared with neither condition. Depression was a stronger predictor than burnout and demonstrated a consistent association with other suicide risk factors regardless of whether burnout was present. In contrast, burnout was not consistently associated with other suicide risk factors when depression was present. The sample was limited to one state-supported academic medical center; to individuals who elected to take the online survey; and relied on a single item, non-validated measure of burnout. When emotional distress is reported by healthcare workers, attention should not stop at ""burnout,"" as burnout frequently comingles with clinical depression, a serious and treatable mental health condition.","['Burnout, Professionalepidemiologypsychology', 'Depressionpsychology', 'Depressive Disorder, Majordiagnosisepidemiology', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Occupational Stressepidemiology', 'Suicidepsychology']","['Burnout', 'Depression', 'Intense affective states', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide risk']",Journal Article
36447331,Burnout in oral health students: A scoping review.,"Student burnout can be defined as the negative reactions that occur because of prolonged academic stress, which can result in emotional exhaustion/exhaustion (EE/EX), depersonalization/cynicism, and diminished personal accomplishment/reduced academic efficacy (DPA/RAE). The purpose of this scoping review is to determine if burnout is prevalent in oral health students (OHS); identify the factors that are shown to be predicators of burnout in OHS; determine the preventive and coping strategies OHS used to mitigate the effects of burnout; and identify gaps in the literature on burnout in OHS. A systematic search was completed using the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EBSCO, and ERIC. The returns were screened by all members of the team using inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the studies that met the criteria were appraised. Eighteen studies assessed burnout in OHS, 15 studied dental students, 2 studied dental hygiene students, and 1 studied both. Findings concerning the prevalence of burnout varied greatly across the literature with anywhere between 7% and 70.4% of OHS reporting suffering from burnout syndrome. The most prevalent scale of burnout in OHS was EE/EX with 10%-66.2% of OHS reporting high levels. Stressors for OHS were years of study, clinical components, and demanding academic courses. Early identification and interventions are keys to prevent the negative consequences of burnout. Burnout in OHS can affect their mental health, empathy toward patients, and professional conduct. Therefore, educating students and faculty on the signs and symptoms of burnout is key in preventing detrimental effects that may inhibit their academic success.","['Humans', 'Oral Health', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Burnout, Psychological', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiology', 'Studentspsychology']","['burnout', 'dental education', 'dental hygiene students', 'dental students', 'depersonalization or cynicism', 'diminished personal accomplishment or reduced academic efficacy', 'emotional exhaustion or exhaustion']",Review
34946406,Exploring Global Research Trends in Burnout among Nursing Professionals: A Bibliometric Analysis.,"Nursing professionals are constantly exposed to several risk factors and high levels of stress that can affect their mental, emotional, and physical health, which can trigger burnout syndrome. This article aims to use bibliometric analysis to investigate burnout research trends among nursing professionals worldwide and to compare the contributions of different countries/institutions, scientific journals, authors, keywords, and citations. A bibliometric study was performed using the Scopus and Web of Science databases, in the period up to November 2021, aiming to search original and review articles in the English language regarding burnout in nursing professionals. The analysis was performed with a sample of 1406 articles. The most cited article indicated that 43% of nurses had high burnout scores, and a similar percentage were dissatisfied with their work. The most productive and most cited country in the world was the United States of America. Regarding the 10 most cited documents, there were no studies that could provide interventions to reduce burnout in nursing professionals, which can result in a need to develop studies on prevention capable of mitigating the problem, in view of the impacts generated on their mental, emotional, and physical health.",[],"['bibliometric study', 'burnout syndrome', 'nursing professionals']",Review
22576135,Emergency and crisis management: critical incident stress management for first responders and business organisations.,"A literature review was performed on critical incident stress after September 11th, 2001 (9/11), and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which focused on the need to implement a holistic critical incident stress management programme for first responders and business organisations. Critical incident stress management is required to handle acute stress and other distress in the face of natural or man-made disasters, including terrorist attacks. A holistic approach to community resilience through a well-planned and implemented critical incident stress management programme has been shown in the literature to promote self-help and self-efficacy of individuals and organisations. The interventions and programme elements defined clearly show how a number of different intervention and prevention strategies will promote business and community resilience and also self-efficacy in a culturally-diverse community and organisation. Implementing a critical incident stress management programme within a responding business organisation is critical because of the fact that first responders are the most susceptible every day to exposure to critical incidents that will affect their mental health; and business employees will suffer some of the same maladies as first responders in the event of a disaster or crisis. Utilising the framework provided, a holistic critical incident stress management programme can be implemented to help reduce the effects of burnout, absenteeism, acute stress, post-traumatic stress, substance use and traumatic stress, and to work to promote community resilience and toughen individuals against the effects of stress. Taking care of the needs of the employees of a business organisation, and of those of first responders, is clearly required.","['Crisis Interventionorganization & administration', 'Emergency Responderspsychology', 'Holistic Health', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseasesprevention & control', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumaticprevention & control', 'Stress, Psychologicalprevention & control', 'Substance-Related Disordersprevention & control']",[],Review
36204751,The impact of mindfulness practice on physician burnout: A scoping review.,"Physician burnout is a growing phenomenon in current health systems worldwide. With the emergence of COVID-19, burnout in healthcare is progressively becoming a serious concern. Increasing emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment threaten the effective delivery of healthcare. Compassion fatigue and moral injury are a considerable risk to the doctor-patient relationship. These issues can potentially be mitigated by mindfulness practice, which has shown promising results in reducing burnout, restoring compassion, and preventing moral injury in physicians. A scoping review was conducted to investigate the effects of mindfulness practice on physician burnout. High-ranking journals were targeted to analyze high-quality studies and synthesize common themes in the literature. Studies conducted on current practicing physicians were included. Mindfulness practice of varying forms was the main intervention studied. Gray literature and studies conducted only on allied health personnel were excluded from this review. 31 studies were included in this scoping review. Mindfulness practice decreased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization while improving mood, responses to stress, and vigor. Self-awareness, compassion, and empathy were also increased in study participants. From this review, four themes emerged: innovations in mindfulness practice, mindfulness and positive psychology, the impact of mindfulness on work and patient care, and barriers and facilitators to physician mindfulness practice. Mindfulness was widely reported to benefit mental health and well-being, but the studies reviewed seemed to adopt a mono focus and omitted key considerations to healthcare leadership, systems-level culture, and practices. Mindfulness practice is a quintessential component of positive psychology and is inherently linked to effective leadership. A mindful and compassionate physician leader will play a crucial role in addressing current practice gaps, prioritizing staff mental health, and providing a supportive platform for innovation.",[],"['COVID-19', 'burnout', 'compassion fatigue', 'healthcare leadership', 'mindfulness practice', 'moral injury', 'organizational culture', 'physician']",Review
33608986,Investigating the temporal relationship between proactive burnout prevention and burnout: A four-wave longitudinal study.,"Given the detrimental effects of burnout for individuals and organizations, it is of crucial importance to better understand the self-initiated actions employees take to prevent burnout. While such proactive burnout prevention is likely to reduce burnout complaints, these activities may also be frustrated by high burnout levels. This means that proactive burnout prevention and burnout can negatively affect each other over time. The present study used a four-wave longitudinal panel design to investigate temporal relationships between proactive burnout prevention and burnout over 3, 6 and 9 weeks. Participants were 165 employees in the financial services industry who provided data on all four measurement occasions. The outcomes of structural equation modelling provided support for the hypothesized combined effects model compared to the lagged and reversed effects models. The findings suggest that proactive burnout prevention can help to prevent burnout, while engagement in these behaviours may be hindered by high initial levels of burnout. Employees should therefore intervene before their resource pool becomes too depleted and they lack the energy or mental strength to invest resources, in order to proactively retain or regain resources.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['burnout', 'prevention', 'proactive behaviours', 'temporal relationship']",Journal Article

36099551,A Phenomenological Understanding of Mental Health Nurses' Experiences of Self-Care: A Review of the Empirical Literature.,"Nurses are central to health care as the largest professional workforce and the providers of constant, ongoing care. Difficulties retaining enough qualified and motivated nurses presents an ongoing problem that threatens the quality of healthcare delivery. Demands of nursing practice, often resulting in stress and burnout, is a major barrier to retaining nurses. Self-care approaches and techniques have proven effective in reducing stress and burnout, increasing job satisfaction and the likelihood of nurses remaining in the profession. Despite knowing the benefits, nurses frequently do not engage in self-care resulting in negative consequences both personally and professionally. To advance our knowledge in this important area, a review of the literature was conducted to explore nurses' experience of self-care and how they made sense of their experiences. The literature was analysed critically and synthesised through a phenomenological lens. The identified themes were structured according to phenomenological concerns: selfhood, mood and embodiment, sociality and relatedness, temporality, spatiality, and nursing culture. Understanding self-care from a phenomenological perspective is important to forming a deeper comprehension of nurses' relationship with self-care, including acceptance and resistance. This new knowledge can be used to develop strategies to encourage self-care. The implications for recruitment and retention within nursing, and ultimately to the quality of healthcare, are significant.","['Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Self Care', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Staff, Hospitalpsychology']",[],Journal Article
37437718,Occupational stress and depression of Korean employees: Moderated mediation model of burnout and grit.,"The present study investigated an interpersonal model of development of depressive symptoms in employees, where occupational stress affects burnout, which in turn affects risk for depression, and whether this mediation is moderated by grit. A total of 11,421 participants, aged 19 to 65 years, who were employees of 18 private companies and local government organizations in Korea were included. They completed questionnaires, including the Korean version of occupational stress scale, Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and Grit scale. Mediation and moderation analyses were carried out in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences PROCESS macro. The association between occupational stress and depressive symptoms was mediated by exhaustion (b = -0.256, 95 % CI [0.244, 0.268]) and disengagement (b = -0.052, 95 % CI [0.039, 0.065]). Moreover, the effect of exhaustion on depressive symptoms was moderated by each grit, with the effect being stronger for employees with low grit (b = 0.939, p < 0.001 for passion and b = 0.629, p < 0.001 for perseverance) than for those with high grit (b = 0.944, p < 0.001 for passion and b = 0.686, p < 0.001 for perseverance). The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow causal inferences. These findings contribute to the understanding of how occupational stress predicts depressive symptoms in the workplace and provide practical implications for preventing burnout and nurturing grit to protect employees' mental health in the workplace.",[],"['Burnout', 'Depression', 'Grit', 'Occupational stress', 'Workplace mental health']",Journal Article
25553235,Mandatory physical exercise for the prevention of mental illness in medical students.,"Medical students experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population. With competition rising for success in medical school, and residency, increasing incidence of distress are leading this population to experience higher rates of thoughts of dropping out of school, and even suicide. Since many stigmas deter medical students from receiving mental health counseling, such as the perceived inability to handle the stresses of medical school, and the potential lack of competitiveness for residencies if reported, prevention of mental illness may be a better course to take in reducing prevalence in this population. Regular exercise has demonstrated a positive effect on not only promoting physical health, but also mental health. Exercise encourages a healthy mood, positive self esteem, and better cognition, while decreasing the chances of depression, anxiety, and burnout. Implementing exercise time into medical school curriculums, just like the basic sciences, albeit for less time in the day, could provide a feasible way to ensure that all students are taking time to partake in this important activity for their well being. Though medical schools are rigid with attempts to make changes in their curriculum, thirty minutes a day, three to five times a week of exercise of the students' choice not only is more cost effective than counseling, but it also reduces the chances that they will experience burnout, which if left untreated could transcend into a compromised training experience.",[],"['exercise', 'medical student', 'mental illness', 'prevention']",Review
35564934,Stress-Inducing Factors vs. the Risk of Occupational Burnout in the Work of Nurses and Paramedics.,"Contemporary healthcare faces new challenges and expectations from society. The profession of a nurse, as well as a paramedic, is essential for the efficient functioning of healthcare. It has its importance not only in promoting and preserving health but also in prevention. With the increasing importance of providing medical care at the highest level, it is expected of these two professional groups to have more knowledge and skills than a few years earlier. The daily contact with patients and their families, the low level of control of the environment, the hierarchical system of professional dependence, and the dissatisfaction with remuneration are becoming extremely burdensome aspects of the nursing and paramedic professions. Long-term exposure to stressors associated with these medical professions may, in the long term, lead to the emergence of occupational burnout syndrome. The aim of this study is an attempt to answer the question of whether and how stress factors affect the occurrence of occupational burnout in the work of nurses and paramedics working in various medical entities. The study covered a group of 434 respondents, including 220 nurses and 214 paramedics, working professionally in hospital departments and care and treatment facilities as well as in hospital emergency departments and ambulance services. The study was carried out using a diagnostic survey based on the questionnaire technique using the authors' questionnaire and the standardized MBI Ch. Maslach. Two statistical values were used to statistically analyze the research results and verify the adopted hypotheses: the chi-square test and the Student's t-test. The current study showed that the phenomenon of occupational burnout among the studied group affects only nurses, while this problem does not apply to the studied paramedics. The main stressor among the nurses and paramedics is, above all, a very high level of responsibility. Nurses are overburdened by excessive demands and shift work, while paramedics are mostly burdened by an excess of duties. Both nurses and paramedics claim that their work is often stressful, which leads to physical and mental exhaustion.","['Allied Health Personnel', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiology', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Humans', 'Nurses', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['burnout', 'nurses', 'paramedics', 'stress']",Journal Article
35989635,Factors Influencing Nurses' Self Care Practices.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed nurses to more stress and inability to practice self-care activities. These have resulted in conditions that threaten their health, well-being, and ability to work. Nurses' lack of self-care can predispose them to chronic health conditions and staff burnout which may adversely affect patient care. The panacea for this concern is a deliberate effort to promote holistic health and wellbeing through self-care activities targeted towards physical, mental, social and spiritual aspects of nurses. The purpose of this study was to explore factors influencing self-care practices among registered nurses during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to select 294 nurses from four urban hospitals in Kingston Jamaica. A questionnaire was utilized for data collection. Logistical regression analysis was conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 22.0. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: The response rate was 46% (Out of 294 questionnaires distributed, only 136 were returned). Although 93% of participants engage in self-care activities during COVID-19 pandemic, only 45% practiced self-care on a daily basis. Half of the participants (50%) practiced self care activities sometimes while 5% do not engage in self care practices. Activities that promote psychological and social wellbeing were not common among participants. Most self care activities were towards the promotion of physical health and wellbeing. Majority of respondents indicated that excess workload, fatigue, lack of time and poor remuneration are factors that prevent their practice of self-care. Findings also revealed that demographic data such as age, sex, income, gender and ethnic background influences self-care practices among nurses. Conclusion: The practice of self care among nurses needs improvements. Although respondents engage in some activities to care for self, majority are not consistent with this practice.",[],"['COVID-19 pandemic', 'holistic health', 'holistic wellbeing', 'hospitals', 'registered nurses', 'self care', 'self care practices']",Journal Article
37484670,"Resilient, but for how long? The relationships between temperament, burnout, and mental health in healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Dispositional traits of wellbeing and stress-reaction are strong predictors of mood symptoms following stressful life events, and the COVID-19 pandemic introduced many life stressors, especially for healthcare workers. We longitudinally investigated the relationships among positive and negative temperament group status (created according to wellbeing and stress-reaction personality measures), burnout (exhaustion, interpersonal disengagement), COVID concern (e.g., health, money worries), and moral injury (personal acts, others' acts) as predictors of generalized anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in 435 healthcare workers. Participants were employees in healthcare settings in North Central Florida who completed online surveys monthly for 8 months starting in October/November 2020. Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire subscale scores for stress-reaction and wellbeing were subjected to K-means cluster analyses that identified two groups of individuals, those with high stress-reaction and low wellbeing (negative temperament) and those with the opposite pattern defined as positive temperament (low stress-reaction and high wellbeing). Repeated measures ANOVAs assessed all time points and ANCOVAs assessed the biggest change at timepoint 2 while controlling for baseline symptoms. The negative temperament group reported greater mood symptoms, burnout, and COVID concern, than positive temperament participants overall, and negative participants' scores decreased over time while positive participants' scores increased over time. Burnout appeared to most strongly mediate this group-by-time interaction, with the burnout exhaustion scale driving anxiety and depression symptoms. PTSD symptoms were also related to COVID-19 health worry and negative temperament. Overall, results suggest that individuals with higher stress-reactions and more negative outlooks on life were at risk for anxiety, depression, and PTSD early in the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with positive temperament traits became more exhausted and thus more symptomatic over time. Targeting interventions to reduce mood symptoms in negative temperament individuals and prevent burnout/exhaustion in positive temperament individuals early in an extended crisis may be an efficient and effective approach to reduce the mental health burden on essential workers.",[],"['Covid-19 pandemic', 'PTSD', 'anxiety', 'burnout', 'depression', 'healthcare workers', 'longitudinal', 'temperament']",Journal Article
36948157,Effects of occupation-specific vocal stress on the mental health of day care teachers.,"Kindergarten teachers are exposed to numerous kinds of strains, such as noise, which can negatively affect their voices. This cross-sectional study investigates whether and to what extent the profession-specific high vocal demand is associated with the educators' mental health. One hundred and ninety-two kindergarten teachers from Magdeburg, Germany and its surrounding areas aged 43.4 ± 12.8 years, voluntarily participated in a survey. Vocal demand and vocal demand response, general strain factors, and mental health were assessed by using questionnaires (self-check on voice demands, Rudow checklist, General Health Questionnaire, and Maslach Burnout Inventory). The statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS. The interviewed educators felt stressed by the excessive number of work tasks and children in each class, noisy work environment, and loud conversations. In addition, educators complained of headaches and neck pain (66%), while 28% of them experienced hoarseness and a burning throat. The mental health of 39 of the educators was impaired, and nine were at an increased risk of burnout. Self-reported voice effort correlated low with mental health (r =.287; p < 0,001) and burnout risk (r =.306; p < 0.001). The vocal demands on educators in day care settings are very high, which is a major associated factor for the development of burnout syndrome and is also associated with headaches and neck pain. Measures for the prevention of occupational voice disorders and voice training should be a mandatory part of the educators' training and must be offered as in-service training.",[],[],Journal Article
32462783,Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of surgeons and coping strategies.,"Unprecedented times call for extraordinary measures. While surgeons across the globe try to comprehend the evolving facade of the COVID-19 pandemic and improvise surgical practice to the best of their ability, the psychological impact of the stress on their own mental health and well-being has been underestimated. This paper aims to review the indirect and overt factors that may affect the mental health of a surgeon in the present circumstances. Furthermore, it will aim to highlight key coping mechanisms at an individual and institutional level, so as to mitigate the negative psychological impact on surgeons.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Anxietyetiology', 'Betacoronavirus', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'COVID-19', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Coronavirus Infectionsepidemiologypsychologytransmission', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professionalprevention & control', 'Life Style', 'Mindfulness', 'Occupational Exposureprevention & control', 'Pandemics', 'Personal Protective Equipment', 'Pneumonia, Viralepidemiologypsychologytransmission', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Self Care', 'Social Isolation', 'Social Support', 'Stress, Psychologicaletiology', 'Surgeonspsychology']","['COVID-19 impact', 'head neck', 'mental health', 'otolaryngology', 'surgeons']",Journal Article

33790702,Physician Burnout: A Lifestyle Medicine Perspective.,"Physician burnout, as described in North America, is a multidimensional work-related syndrome that includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a low sense of accomplishment from work. More than 50% of physicians were reporting symptoms of burnout prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This silent epidemic of burnout is bound to become less silent as the pandemic continues. Lifestyle medicine is an evidence-based discipline that describes how daily habits and health practices can affect overall health and well-being of individuals. Lifestyle Medicine can potentially play a significant role in preventing and ameliorating physician burnout. This article explores the burnout process, including the historical context, international definitions, symptoms, and imprecision of the clinical diagnosis. The systemic etiological issues are discussed, and the psychological underpinnings are explored, including physicians' personal vulnerabilities contributing to burnout. The stress response and lifestyle medicine's role in healthy coping are described. A prevention model for risk factor reduction is proposed, focusing on primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. Lifestyle medicine clinicians' role in prevention, treatment, and advocacy to ameliorate the potential for burnout is discussed along with specific recommendations.",[],"['and tertiary prevention', 'lifestyle medicine', 'physician burnout risk reduction', 'primary', 'primordial', 'psychological vulnerabilities to burnout', 'secondary', 'stress response']",Journal Article
17219947,The older anaesthetist.,"It is not possible to generalise about the way in which increasing years affect the performance of an individual anaesthetist. Physical and mental deterioration occurs as we age; most anaesthetists will be able to reach the normal retirement age of 65 years without that deterioration affecting their clinical practice. In some, however, decreasing competence and an unwillingness to embrace a continuing education regime may offer a direct threat to patient safety. Stress and 'burnout' are common in anesthetists; clinical depression can often be one of the factors involved. Continuing involvement in the on-call rota is a potent stressor. Airline pilots are required to retire at 60 years; the feasibility and desirability of applying this process to anaesthetists are discussed. Employers have a duty to provide employees with adequate and achievable demands in relation to their agreed hours of work and to have in place policies and procedures to offer adequate support.","['Aged', 'Anesthesiology', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & controlpsychology', 'Clinical Competence', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Physician Impairmentpsychology', 'Prejudice', 'Quality Assurance, Health Careorganization & administration', 'United Kingdom']",[],Journal Article
21950228,Stress at work and burnout syndrome in hospital doctors.,"Reforming the health care system in Bosnia and Herzegovina began in 1998 through various forms of amendments to existing health plans and programs. There has been the introduction of new technologies, flow of new information from the profession, excessive demands on employers, financial constraints, etc. The hospital doctors in the workplace suffer from too many stressors. Burnout syndrome at work is a form of chronic stress reactions to stressors, and develops as a result of inefficient coping with and solving every day, demanding stressful situations related to professional duties. The goals of this study were: to identify the specific stressors of high intensity in the hospital physicians work environment, to discover whether and how certain stressors can affect the appearance of burnout syndrome at work in a hospital physician, to determine whether certain individual factors influence the occurrence of burnout syndrome at work. We made the intersection study involving the use of questionnaires, in order to assess the stressors and burnout syndrome in hospital among doctors of the University Clinical Center in Tuzla. The study comprised 34.7% hospital doctors (specialists and doctors on specialization) of a total 423 employees in various departments of the University Hospital Clinical Center in Tuzla. High level of emotional exhaustion was recorded in 37.4%, a high level of depersonalization in 45.6%, and a low level in perceptions of personal accomplishments in 50.3% of respondents. Continuous exposure to stressors at the workplace, such as work at shifts, excessive workload, poor communication with superiors, and lack of continuous education of hospital physicians can lead to mental and physical exhaustion, professional burnout. Management of the University Clinical Center Tuzla should in the future address the structural reorganization of workplaces, as well as ongoing prevention interventions in other domains of risk factors or stressors, that this study identified.","['Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Burnout, Professionaldiagnosisetiology', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Medical Staff, Hospitalpsychology', 'Personality', 'Stress, Psychologicalcomplicationsdiagnosis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",[],Journal Article
22388107,Avoiding burnout: the personal health habits and wellness practices of US surgeons.,"To evaluate the health habits, routine medical care practices, and personal wellness strategies of American surgeons and explore associations with burnout and quality of life (QOL). Burnout and low mental QOL are common among US surgeons and seem to adversely affect quality of care, job satisfaction, career longevity, and risk of suicide. The self-care strategies and personal wellness promotion practices used by surgeons to deal with the stress of practice are not well explored. Members of the American College of Surgeons were sent an anonymous, cross-sectional survey in October 2010. The survey included self-assessment of health habits, routine medical care practices, and personal wellness strategies and standardized assessments of burnout and QOL. Of 7197 participating surgeons, 3911 (55.0%) participated in aerobic exercise and 2611 (36.3%) in muscle strengthening activities, in a pattern consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. The overall and physical QOL scores were superior for surgeons' following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations (all P < 0.0001). A total of 3311 (46.2%) participating surgeons had seen their primary care provider in the last 12 months. Surgeons who had seen their primary care provider in the last 12 months were more likely to be up to date with all age-appropriate health care screening and had superior overall and physical QOL scores (all P < 0.0001). Ratings of the importance of 16 personal wellness promotion strategies differed for surgeons without burnout (all P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, surgeons placing greater emphasis on finding meaning in work, focusing on what is important in life, maintaining a positive outlook, and embracing a philosophy that stresses work/life balance were less likely to be burned out (all P < 0.0001). Although many factors associated with lower risk of burnout were also associated with achieving a high overall QOL, notable differences were observed, indicating surgeons' need to employ a broader repertoire of wellness promotion practices if they desire to move beyond neutral and achieve high well-being. This study identifies specific measures surgeons can take to decrease burnout and improve their personal and professional QOL.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'General Surgery', 'Health Behavior', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physicianspsychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Care', 'United States']",[],Journal Article
37053471,Steps toward a resilient future nurse workforce.,"The psychosocial needs of nursing students are a pressing matter as mental health disorders may affect nursing students' journeys as professional nurses. Psychological distress and burnout in nurses are threats to worldwide health care, as the stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to an unstable future global nurse workforce. Resiliency training can positively impact nurse stress, mindfulness, and resilience, as resilient nurses are better able to manage their response to stress and adversity which will contribute to positive patient outcomes. Educating faculty on resilience will aid nurse educators to create new student instructional approaches to improve mental health wellness. Supportive faculty behaviors, self-care techniques, and resilience-building infused throughout the nursing curriculum may promote the effective transitioning of students into practice, providing the necessary foundation for improving workplace stress management and increasing longevity and satisfaction in the profession.","['Humans', 'Pandemics', 'COVID-19epidemiology', 'Occupational Stressprevention & controlpsychology', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & controlpsychology', 'Workforce', 'Resilience, Psychological']","['mental health', 'nurse educators', 'nursing students', 'resiliency']",Journal Article
36191645,Implementation context and burnout among Department of Veterans Affairs psychotherapists prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The first goal of this study was to assess longitudinal changes in burnout among psychotherapists prior to (T1) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (T2). The second objective was to assess the effects of job demands, job resources (including organizational support for evidence-based psychotherapies, or EBPs) and pandemic-related stress (T2 only) on burnout. Psychotherapists providing EBPs for posttraumatic stress disorder in U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities completed surveys assessing burnout, job resources, and job demands prior to (T1; n = 346) and during (T2; n = 193) the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout prevalence increased from 40 % at T1 to 56 % at T2 (p < .001). At T1, stronger implementation climate and implementation leadership (p < .001) and provision of only cognitive processing therapy (rather than use of prolonged exposure therapy or both treatments; p < .05) reduced burnout risk. Risk factors for burnout at T2 included T1 burnout, pandemic-related stress, less control over when and how to deliver EBPs, being female, and being a psychologist rather than social worker (p < .02). Implementation leadership did not reduce risk of burnout at T2. This study involved staff not directly involved in treating COVID-19, in a healthcare system poised to transition to telehealth delivery. Organizational support for using EBPs reduced burnout risk prior to but not during the pandemic. Pandemic related stress rather than increased work demands contributed to elevated burnout during the pandemic. A comprehensive approach to reducing burnout must address the effects of both work demands and personal stressors.","['Humans', 'Female', 'Male', 'COVID-19epidemiologyprevention & control', 'Pandemicsprevention & control', 'Psychotherapists', 'Veterans', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiologypsychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Job Satisfaction']","['Burnout', 'COVID-19', 'Healthcare professionals', 'Implementation climate', 'Job demands-resources']",Journal Article

Moreover, there is strong evidence about the positive effects of yoga practice on stress management and prevention of burnout among healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to conduct a single-arm clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of an intervention based on mindfulness-based stress reduction and yoga in improving healthcare workers' quality of life. Healthcare workers of two hospitals in Rome were enrolled in a 4-week yoga and mindfulness course. Four questionnaires were administered at different times (Short Form-12 (SF-12), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Y1 and Y2, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)) to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Forty participants took part to the study (83.3 %). The Mental Composite Score-12, that is part of the quality of life assessment, passed from a median of 43.5 preintervention to 48.1 postintervention (p = 0.041), and the negative affect passed from a score of 16 in the preintervention to 10 in the postintervention (p < 0.001). Both the forms of the STAI questionnaires showed a decrease after the intervention.

This is a descriptive cross-sectional study performed in a women's correctional facility located in Aquiraz, in the state of Ceará, through the use of 3 evaluation instruments: the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument, and a general information questionnaire. Most of the correctional officers were married or cohabiting, aged between 31 and 40 years old, with complete or partial undergraduate education, and at least 1 child. In the burnout investigation, mean scores were 1.9±1.43, indicating a moderate level of burnout. Regarding quality of life, the environment domain presented the lowest scores (57.34%). We observed a correlation between burnout and quality of life, in which the higher the burnout scores, the lower the quality of life reported by correctional officers. Our data demonstrate that correctional officers face a risk of developing burnout, thus affecting their quality of life; therefore, preventive health care measures are required for these professionals.",[],"['burnout', 'correctional facility', 'occupational health', 'quality of life']",Journal Article
26329810,"Mindfulness, perceived stress, and subjective well-being: a correlational study in primary care health professionals.","Primary health care professionals (PHPs) usually report high levels of distress and burnout symptoms related to job strain. Mindfulness, defined as non-judgmental-present-moment awareness, seems to be a moderator in the causal association between life stressors and well-being. This study aimed to verify correlations among self-reported mindfulness, perceived stress (PS), and subjective well-being (SW) in Brazilian PHPs. We performed a correlational cross-sectional study in a purposive sample of Brazilian PHPs (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, and community health workers), working in community-oriented primary care programs (known locally as ""Family Health Programs""). We used validated self-reporting instruments: the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Subjective Well-being Scale (SWS). We performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), through regression coefficients (beta) in relation to the professional category (nursing assistant), in addition to the length of time in the same job (under than 6 months) that had indicated the lowest level of PS. Participants (n=450) comprised community health workers (65.8%), nursing assistants (18%), registered nurses (10.0%), and doctors (family physicians) (6.0%); 94% were female and 83.1% had worked in the same position for more than one year. MANOVA regression analysis showed differences across professional categories and length of time in the same job position in relation to mindfulness, PS, and SW. Nurses demonstrated lower levels of mindfulness, higher PS, and SW negative affect, as well as lower SW positive affect. Being at work for 1 year or longer showed a clear association with higher PS and lower SW positive affect, and no significance with mindfulness levels. Pearson's coefficient values indicated strong negative correlations between mindfulness and PS, and medium correlations between mindfulness and SW. In this study, there were clear correlations between mindfulness, PS, and SW across different primary care professional categories and time in the same job position, suggesting specific vulnerabilities that should be addressed through the development of staff awareness, stress prevention, and well-being interventions.","['Brazilepidemiology', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Health Personnelstatistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mindfulness', 'Primary Health Care', 'Stress, Psychologicalepidemiology']",[],Journal Article

Results revealed that stress relates positively with emotional exhaustion and negatively with personal fulfilment. Emotional exhaustion was associated directly with emotional attention and inversely with emotional clarity and emotional repair, with these being linked to personal fulfilment.

Yet, there is no clear definition for job burnout in nursing. This study aimed to analyze the concept of nurses' occupational burnout. Methods: This concept analysis was conducted, using the three-phase hybrid model. In the theoretical phase, online databases, namely Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), Science Direct, MagIran, ProQuest, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and PubMed were searched to retrieve studies published from 2007 to 2018. In the fieldwork phase, twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurses and head-nurses selected from teaching hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed through thematic analysis. In the final analytic phase, the findings of the first and the second phases were combined. Results: Based on the findings of the theoretical and the fieldwork phases, job burnout can be defined as, ""a state of physical, mental, emotional, and social exhaustion resulting from the negative effects of unmanaged occupational stress and inadequate managerial and social support, which reduces interest in and motivation for work, affects care quality, and results in negative attitudes and behavior towards self, clients, and the work"". Conclusion: This study provides an in-depth understanding of the concept of job burnout in the nursing context of Iran.

16255316,Stress in health professions students: myth or reality? A review of the existing literature.,"The purpose of this literature review was to determine the extent to which health profession students experience counterproductive stress and to examine the existing gaps in the literature concerning all health profession students and stress. The literature search process included using Eric, Education Abstracts, Psyc INFO, ABIN, WebSpirs Databases, FactSearch, Biological Sciences, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, MEDLINE, Lexis-Nexis, CINAHL and Registry of Nursing Research. Key articles were identified that documented stress, the causes of stress or ""stressors,"" and psychiatric symptoms as a result of counterproductive stress in the disciplines of medicine, dentistry, nursing, and allied health. Findings from this analysis of the literature indicated that the highest incidence of stress occurred in medical students followed by dental and then nursing students. There was, however, a dearth of studies related to stress in pharmacy students alone, despite the fact that pharmacology requires a rigorous educational process that is similar to that of the other health professions. While it may be argued that pharmacy students may not be experiencing the detrimental levels of stress that affect other medical students, a study by Henning Ey, & Shaw (1998) found a disproportionately high level of distress in pharmacy students. The Henning study also compared the stress levels of medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy students. This literature review documents that health profession students suffer from high levels of stress during their training. A comprehensive list of ""stressors"" is delineated for the health education profession students. However, there appears to be a lack of emperical evidence with regards to stress and stressors in pharmacy students. Although it can be extrapolated that pharmacy students may be suffering from similar levels of stress, there is a definite need for research in pharmacy students specifically.","['Burnout, Professionalepidemiologyetiologyprevention & controlpsychology', 'Conflict, Psychological', 'Familypsychology', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Interprofessional Relations', 'Mental Health', 'Occupational Health', 'Peer Group', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Concept', 'Social Support', 'Student Dropouts', 'Students, Health Occupationspsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'Time Management', 'Workload']",[],Review

This study tests the mediation effect of school burnout in the association between academic stress and adolescent depression, and whether this mediation is moderated by self-esteem. Methods A sample of 552 Chinese adolescents in junior high schools (mean age = 14.48 years, SD = 0.98) is obtained through multi-stage cluster random sampling. Mediation and moderation analyses are carried out in SPSS macro PROCESS. Results The association between academic stress and depression is found to be mediated by school burnout (b = 0.200, 95% CI [0.145, 0.263]). Moreover, the effect of school burnout on depression is moderated by self-esteem, with the effect being stronger for adolescents with low self-esteem (b = 0.377, p < 0.001) than for those with high self-esteem (b = 0.218, p < 0.001). Limitations The cross-sectional design of the study does not allow causal inferences. Conclusions These findings contribute to the understanding of how academic stress predicts adolescent depression, and provide practical implications for prevention and intervention programs to protect adolescents' mental health in the school setting.","['Adolescent', 'Burnout, Psychological', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Schools', 'Self Concept']","['Academic stress', 'Depression', 'School burnout', 'Self-esteem']",Journal Article

The present article responds to the recent U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) call to assess workforce well-being. This article held the following aims: (1) to quantify existing levels of mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, distress, and posttraumatic stress) and subjective well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and four domains of burnout) and (2) to evaluate Coping Self-Efficacy (CSE) and Need for Affect (NFA) as factors associated with staff mental health and subjective well-being. We conducted a voluntary cross-sectional health needs assessment of forensic mental health staff (N = 170) between 2017 and 2018 from one National Health Service (NHS) Trust. Descriptive findings suggest staff possessed nonclinical average ranges of mental health symptoms. Subjective well-being findings showed burnout was relatively low, whereas job and life satisfaction were modest. Regression models demonstrated that (a) thought/emotion stopping beliefs were negatively associated with psychological exhaustion; (b) social support beliefs were positively associated with life satisfaction and job enthusiasm; (c) NFA Avoidance was linked with poor mental health and burnout, and; (d) NFA Approach was positively associated with two health subjective well-being indicators. Overall, assessment results suggest NHS forensic mental health staff reported relatively good health. Cognitive- and emotion-focused coping beliefs demonstrate promise as content for prevention programming. Using Emotional Labor Theory, we offer psychological services-based recommendations for future prevention programming and research.

36813045,Moral obligation to follow anti-COVID-19 measures strengthens the mental health cost of pandemic burnout.,"It has been observed that people become gradually exhausted by receiving COVID-19-related information and adhering to the corresponding preventive measures as the pandemic unfolds. This phenomenon is known as pandemic burnout. Emerging evidence shows that pandemic burnout is related to poor mental health. This study extended the trendy topic by examining the idea that moral obligation, a crucial motivation driving people to follow the preventive measures, would amplify the mental health cost of pandemic burnout. Participants were 937 Hong Kong citizens (88 % females, 62.4 % aged 31-40 years). They participated in a cross-sectional online survey reporting on pandemic burnout, moral obligation, and mental health problems (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress). Findings of moderation model analyses showed that higher levels of pandemic burnout and moral obligation were related to more mental health problems. Importantly, the ""pandemic burnout-mental health problems"" links were moderated by moral obligation, with those who felt more morally obliged to follow the measures reporting poorer mental health than those who felt less morally obliged to do so. The cross-sectional design of the study may constrain the evidence about the directions and causality of the relationships. Participants were only recruited from Hong Kong and females were over-represented, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings. People who experience pandemic burnout while feeling more morally obliged to follow the anti-COVID-19 measures are at greater risk of mental health problems. They might need more mental health support from medical professionals.","['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Moral Obligations', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Mental Health', 'Pandemics', 'COVID-19', 'Burnout, Psychological', 'Burnout, Professional']","['COVID-19', 'Morality', 'Pandemic burnout', 'Psychological distress', 'Self-determination theory']",Journal Article
25851427,Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers.,"The teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work-related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational-level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard. To evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies of organisational-level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Four studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster-randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped-wedge design.Changing task characteristicsOne study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task-based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from -3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low-quality evidence).Changing organisational characteristicsTwo studies compared teacher training combined with school-wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job-related anxiety (MD -0.25 95% CI -0.61 to 0.11, very low-quality evidence) or depression (MD -0.26 95% CI -0.57 to 0.05, very low-quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD -0.05 95% CI -0.52 to 0.42, low-quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI -0.11 to 0.33, low-quality evidence) after six months.Multi-component interventionOne study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi-component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched-comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow-up, very low-quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias. We found low-quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates.

34277931,"An Educational Workshop to Improve Neurology Resident Understanding of Burnout, Substance Abuse, and Mood Disorders.","Burnout, substance abuse, and mood disorders are prevalent among neurology residents. Increased recognition of concerning behaviors might encourage more access to mental health resources and reduce burnout. We created an educational resource reviewing burnout, substance abuse, and mood disorders for neurology residents. This resource included an online module (control) and a role-play scenario offered only to one cohort (intervention). Online surveys assessed knowledge as well as confidence in the ability to recognize concerning behaviors. A practical assessment using a previously published ""Stressed Resident"" video was also conducted among resident cohorts. Of neurology residents, 18 participated in the activity, with nine in the control group and nine in the intervention group. In the postvideo survey, the residents who participated in a role-play activity outperformed a control cohort of their peers when identifying signs of burnout, mood disorders, and substance abuse portrayed in the video (84% vs. 72%; t test, p = .01). Residents indicated increased confidence in the ability to recognize symptoms of maladaptive stress as well as identify resources for themselves and peers. Participants demonstrated no difference in knowledge-based questions scores on pre- and postactivity assessments. Our educational resource improved resident ability to recognize signs of maladaptive stress and to identify residents that are a risk to patient safety. The activity is easy to implement and can be easily adapted outside neurology. Limited sample sizes may limit the ability to demonstrate this tool's impact on knowledge of burnout, substance abuse, and mood disorders.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Substance-Related Disorders']","['Burnout', 'Neurology', 'Physician Impairment', 'Role-Play', 'Substance Abuse', 'Well-Being/Mental Health', 'Wellness']",Journal Article

Stressors, burnout and social support: nurses in acute mental health settings. Journal of Advanced Nursing 48 (6), 622-631], with cancer nursing being identified as a particularly stressful occupation [Hinds, P.S., Sanders, C.B., Srivastava, D.K., Hickey, S., Jayawardene, D., Milligan, M., Olsen, M.S., Puckett, P., Quargnenti, A., Randall, E.A., Tyc, V., 1998.

Relationships between stressors, work supports and burnout among cancer nurses. Cancer Nursing 29 (4), 338-345]. Terminologies used to capture this stress are burnout [Pines, A.M., and Aronson, E., 1988. Career Burnout: Causes and Cures. Free Press, New York], compassion stress [Figley, C.R., 1995. Compassion Fatigue. Brunner/Mazel, New York], emotional contagion [Miller, K.I., Stiff, J.B., Ellis, B.H., 1988. Communication and empathy as precursors to burnout among human service workers. Communication Monographs 55 (9), 336-341] or simply the cost of caring (Figley, 1995). However, in the mental health field such as psychology and counselling, there is terminology used to captivate this impact, vicarious traumatisation. Vicarious traumatisation is a process through which the therapist's inner experience is negatively transformed through empathic engagement with client's traumatic material [Pearlman, L.A., Saakvitne, K.W., 1995a. Treating therapists with vicarious traumatization and secondary traumatic stress disorders. In: Figley, C.R. (Ed.), Compassion Fatigue: Coping with Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder in Those Who Treat the Traumatized. Brunner/Mazel, New York, pp. 150-177]. Trauma not only affects individuals who are primarily present, but also those with whom they discuss their experience. If an individual has been traumatised as a result of a cancer diagnosis and shares this impact with oncology nurses, there could be a risk of vicarious traumatisation in this population. However, although Thompson [2003. Vicarious traumatisation: do we adequately support traumatised staff? The Journal of Cognitive Rehabilitation 24-25] suggests that vicarious traumatisation is a broad term used for workers from any profession, it has not yet been empirically determined if oncology nurses experience vicarious traumatisation. This purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of vicarious traumatisation and argue that it should be explored in oncology nursing. The review will highlight that empirical research in vicarious traumatisation is largely limited to the mental health professions, with a strong recommendation for the need to empirically determine whether this concept exists in oncology nursing.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Burnout, Professionaletiologyprevention & controlpsychology', 'Communication', 'Cost of Illness', 'Countertransference', 'Empathy', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Imagination', 'Mental Health', 'Models, Psychological', ""Nurse's Rolepsychology"", 'Nurse-Patient Relations', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Nursing Staff, Hospitaleducationorganization & administrationpsychology', 'Occupational Health', 'Oncology Nursingorganization & administration', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Support', 'Workplace']",[],Review
33845687,Exploring the Effect of Mindfulness on Burnout in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"Burnout is a common phenomenon among health care providers known to adversely affect their mental health and clinical acumen. As mindfulness has been shown to diminish burnout with large-scale interventions, our aim was to assess whether smaller, on-shift activities aimed at increasing mindfulness could decrease burnout among staff in a pediatric emergency department (PED). Prior to the implementation of a series of mindfulness-based activities, a diverse cohort of PED staff including nurses, physicians, nurse practitioners, technicians, and administrative personnel completed electronic preintervention surveys about their demographics, personal mindfulness engagement, and individual baseline burnout level using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Trained nurses and physicians served as champions who coordinated on-shift mindfulness activities, and burnout levels were subsequently reassessed using a postintervention survey. Among 83 eligible staff, 75 completed the preintervention and 69 completed the postintervention survey. For the MBI, the majority of staff had moderate to high burnout levels at baseline. Few staff engaged in personal mindfulness activities outside of work. Although 82% of staff participated in the on-shift interventions, no significant differences were found in scores before and after the intervention for emotional exhaustion (20.1 vs. 20, p = .93), depersonalization (7.6 vs. 7.3, p = .97), and personal accomplishment (36.1 vs. 34.8, p = .11). While mindfulness effectively combats burnout, few PED providers regularly practice mindfulness activities. Brief, on-shift mindfulness activities were insufficient to significantly reduce burnout levels. Hospital leadership should consider dedicating resources to more intensive mindfulness activities to combat amplified burnout levels among emergency department staff.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mindfulnessmethodsorganization & administration', 'Pediatric Emergency Medicine', 'Personnel, Hospitalpsychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tertiary Care Centers']","['burnout', 'mindfulness', 'occupation stress', 'pediatric emergency department']",Journal Article

This study also aimed to provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of job burn-out among factory workers and miners. A cross-sectional study based on the factory Workers and Miners of Urumqi, Xinjiang. Demographic biases, that is, confounding factors, were eliminated by the propensity score-matched analysis method. An electronic questionnaire was used to survey 7500 eligible factory workers and miners in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, and 7315 complete questionnaires were returned. A general demographic questionnaire, the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) and the Chinese Maslach Burnout Inventory. The total rate of burn-out was 86.5%. Noise (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.64) and ERI (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.61) were the risk factors for job burn-out among factory workers and miners (p<0.001). The job burn-out rate of factory workers and miners was high, and the noise and occupational stress factors among occupational hazard factors will affect the likelihood of job burn-out of factory workers and miners. We should control the impact of occupational hazards on factory workers and miners and reduce occupational stress to alleviate workers' job burn-out.","['Humans', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Propensity Score', 'Occupational Stressepidemiology', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Stress, Psychologicalepidemiology', 'Job Satisfaction']","['MENTAL HEALTH', 'PSYCHIATRY', 'Public health']",Journal Article
30431462,"Avoiding physician burnout through physical, emotional, and spiritual energy.","The purpose of this review is to update the physician community on current evidence regarding ways individuals can combat the rise in physician burnout. More than half of US physicians are experiencing at least some degree of burnout and the incidence has increased significantly over the past decade. Recent findings suggest practicing physical, mental, and emotional self-care are important factors in avoiding physician burnout. Current evidence demonstrates that physical exercise can improve mood, enhance one's ability to deal with stress, and promote high-quality sleep. New research in the field of nutritional psychiatry supports the association between diet and mental health. A recent study found that the risk of depression is lower in people who eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, unprocessed grains, and low amounts of animal and dairy products. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that practicing mindfulness meditation can help reduce the symptoms of physician burnout by reducing stress and improving physical and emotional well-being. The implications of decreasing physician burnout are improved patient safety, job retention, monetary savings, and better patient care.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Emotions', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Patient Safety', 'Physicianspsychology', 'Spirituality']",[],Journal Article
23611946,Feasibility of a personal health technology-based psychological intervention for men with stress and mood problems: randomized controlled pilot trial.,"Work-related stress is a significant problem for both people and organizations. It may lead to mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, resulting in increased work absences and disabilities. Scalable interventions to prevent and manage harmful stress can be delivered with the help of technology tools to support self-observations and skills training. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the P4Well intervention in treatment of stress-related psychological problems. P4Well is a novel intervention which combines modern psychotherapy (the cognitive behavioral therapy and the acceptance and commitment therapy) with personal health technologies to deliver the intervention via multiple channels, includinggroup meetings, Internet/Web portal, mobile phone applications, and personal monitoring devices. This pilot study design was a small-scale randomized controlled trial that compared the P4Well intervention with a waiting list control group. In addition to personal health technologies for self-assessment, the intervention consisted of 3 psychologist-assisted group meetings. Self-assessed psychological measures through questionnaires were collected offline pre- and post-intervention, and 6 months after the intervention for the intervention group. Acceptance and usage of technology tools were measured with user experience questionnaires and usage logs. A total of 24 subjects were randomized: 11 participants were followed up in the intervention group (1 was lost to follow-up) and 12 participants did not receive any intervention (control group). Depressive and psychological symptoms decreased and self-rated health and working ability increased. All participants reported they had benefited from the intervention. All technology tools had active users and 10/11 participants used at least 1 tool actively. Physiological measurements with personal feedback were considered the most useful intervention component. Our results confirm the feasibility of the intervention and suggest that it had positive effects on psychological symptoms, self-rated health, and self-rated working ability. The intervention seemed to have a positive impact on certain aspects of burnout and job strain, such as cynicism and over-commitment. Future studies need to investigate the effectiveness, benefits, and possible problems of psychological interventions which incorporate new technologies.

36927231,Compassion fatigue and moral sensitivity in midwives in COVID-19.,"The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted compassion fatigue and the mental health of health care providers, particularly midwives and nurses. Although there are studies involving health workers such as nurses and physicians affected by the pandemic's compassion fatigue, few studies include midwives. The present study seeks to investigate the effects of compassion fatigue experienced by midwives working under intense stress during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of moral sensitivity. This is a descriptive-correlation study. The statistical population consisted of all the midwives in Türkiye hospitals in 2021. This cross-sectional study was collected through a questionnaire using convenience sampling. Three hundred and ten midwives working in different units of the country participated in the study. Approval from the researcher's university Institutional Review Board for ethical review was obtained with the code of IRB 20/510. The average age of the midwives is 34.29 ± 8.39. It has been noticed that 43.5% of the midwives work in public hospitals and 38.1% in family health and community health centers. Midwives' mean MR-CS score is 67.11 ± 25.13, secondary trauma sub-dimension average 15.77 ± 6.23, and occupational burnout sub-dimension 40.69 ± 16.35. The mean moral sensitivity questionnaire score is determined as 93.86 ± 19.51. It has been observed that the working style and working time are effective on compassion fatigue. In the linear regression model, 98% of compassion fatigue was explained. Age, secondary trauma, and occupational burnout sub-dimensions affect the model. Working year, working style, second trauma, age, and occupational burnout parameters may help explain some of the links between midwives' symptoms of compassion fatigue. The pandemic affects the compassion fatigue of midwives. It is crucial to provide social support to midwives and health workers to prevent compassion fatigue and examine and control groups at risk in mental health.",[],"['Compassion fatigue', 'covid-19 pandemic', 'midwifery', 'moral sensitivity']",Journal Article
36586602,Effects of work-family conflict and anxiety in the relationship between work-related stress and job burnout in Chinese female nurses: A chained mediation modeling analysis.,"Job burnout among nurses has been a challenging problem in recent years globally and in China. Work-related stress, work-life interference and mental health have been shown to be associated with nurse job burnout. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. This study aims to examine the complex relationships linking work-related stress to nurse burnout among Chinese nurses. Study data were collected from female nurses (n = 2172) in cities of Wuhan, Shiyan and Jingzhou, Hubei Province of China. Job burnout was used as outcome variable, work-related stress was the predictor, work-life interference and anxiety symptoms were mediators. Mediation and chained mediation modeling analysis were used for data analysis. The association between work-related stress and job burnout was significantly mediated by work-family conflict (indirect effect[95%CI] = 0.05[0.05,0.06]) and anxiety symptoms (indirect effect = 0.42[0.36,0.49]), respectively. Further, a chained mediation mechanism was observed with work-family conflict and anxiety symptoms consecutively mediated the relationship between work-related stress and job burnout (indirect effect = 0.02[0.01,0.02]). The data were collected in one province in central China, so it needs caution when generalizing the study findings to other regions within or outside of China. Work-related stress exerts effects on job burnout through work-family conflict and anxiety symptoms among female nurses in China. Work-related stress-based burnout prevention must consider both work-family conflict and mental health problems.","['Humans', 'Female', 'Family Conflict', 'East Asian People', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Burnout, Professionalepidemiologypsychology', 'Occupational Stresspsychology', 'Anxietyepidemiologypsychology', 'China', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Nurses']","['Anxiety symptoms', 'Job burnout', 'Nurse', 'Work-family interference', 'Work-related stress']",Journal Article
33661753,Social Media and Emotional Burnout Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multilevel Approach.,"In February 2020, the Chinese government imposed a complete lockdown of Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province to contain a spike of COVID-19 cases. Although such measures are effective in preventing the spread of the virus, medical professionals strongly voiced a caveat concerning the pandemic emotional burnout at the individual level. Although the lockdown limited individuals' interpersonal communication with people in their social networks, it is common that individuals turn to social media to seek and share health information, exchange social support, and express pandemic-generated feelings. Based on a holistic and multilevel perspective, this study examines how pandemic-related emotional exhaustion enacts intrapersonal, interpersonal, and hyperpersonal emotional regulation strategies, and then evaluates the effectiveness of these strategies, with a particular interest in understanding the role of hyperpersonal-level regulation or social media-based regulation. Using an online panel, this study sampled 538 Chinese internet users from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Survey data collection lasted for 12 days from February 7-18, 2020, two weeks after Hubei Province was placed under quarantine. The sample had an average age of 35 (SD 10.65, range 18-78) years, and a majority were married (n=369, 68.6%). Using structural equation modeling, this study found that intrapersonal-level (B=0.22; β=.24; P<.001) and interpersonal-level (B=0.35; β=.49; P<.001) emotional regulation strategies were positively associated with individuals' outcome reappraisal. In contrast with intrapersonal and interpersonal regulations, hyperpersonal (social media-based) regulation strategies, such as disclosing and retweeting negative emotions, were negatively related to the outcome reappraisal (B=-1.00; β=-.80; P<.001). Consistent with previous literature, intrapersonal-level regulation (eg, cognitive reappraisal, mindfulness, and self-kindness) and interpersonal-level supportive interaction may generate a buffering effect on emotional exhaustion and promote individuals' reappraisal toward the stressful situation. However, hyperpersonal-level regulation may exacerbate the experienced negative emotions and impede reappraisal of the pandemic situation. It is speculated that retweeting content that contains pandemic-related stress and anxiety may cause a digital emotion contagion. Individuals who share other people's negative emotional expressions on social media are likely to be affected by the negative affect contagion. More importantly, the possible benefits of intrapersonal and interpersonal emotion regulations may be counteracted by social media or hyperpersonal regulation. This suggests the necessity to conduct social media-based health communication interventions to mitigate the social media-wide negative affect contagion if lockdown policies related to highly infectious diseases are initiated.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'COVID-19epidemiologypsychology', 'Chinaepidemiology', 'Emotional Regulationphysiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'SARS-CoV-2isolation & purification', 'Social Media', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']","['COVID-19', 'buffer', 'effective', 'emotion', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional exhaustion', 'mental health', 'modeling', 'multilevel approach', 'pandemic', 'perspective', 'social media', 'strategy', 'well-being']",Journal Article
35848495,"Frontline, Essential, and Invisible: The Needs of Low-Wage Workers in Hospital Settings During COVID-19.","Frontline health care workers are particularly vulnerable to burnout and diminished well-being as they endure COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors. While physicians and nurses are the public face of those experiencing burnout in hospitals, these stressors also affect low-wage workers such as food and housekeeping/janitorial service workers whose roles largely remain ""invisible"" when conceptualizing the essential health workforce and understanding their needs. This study sought to understand the experiences of frontline essential workers to better support them and prevent burnout. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we conducted 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with workers in three U.S. states. Thematic content analysis was conducted to code and analyze interviews. Workers had an average of 5.8 years in their jobs, which included food services, housekeeping/janitorial, and patient transport roles. Analysis revealed four prominent stressors contributing to worker burnout: changes in duties and staff shortages, fear of contracting or transmitting COVID-19, desire for recognition of their job-related risk, and unclear communication on safety precautions and resources. Protective factors included paid time-off, mental health supports, sense of workplace pride, and self-coping strategies. As health systems continue to grapple with care delivery in the context of COVID-19, identifying best practices to support all workers and prevent burnout is vital to the functioning and safety of hospitals. Further consideration is warranted to create policies and multipronged interventions to meet workers' tangible needs while shifting the culture, so all members of the health workforce are seen and valued.","['Humans', 'COVID-19', 'Pandemics', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Salaries and Fringe Benefits', 'Hospitals']","['COVID-19', 'behavioral/mental health/stress/anxiety/depression', 'health care worker/homecare worker', 'low-wage worker', 'qualitative research methods']",Journal Article

Effects of Multidimensional Path Analysis.","International research has demonstrated that emergency call operators face unique risks to their mental health, in particular job stress, and occupational burnout syndrome. There is already wide knowledge about the relationship between stress, burnout and employee personal resources, which has practical application in preventing mental health. However, more research into the subtle relationships between variables is needed. The aim of the study was to check the moderation effect of differences in the intensity of latent variables on the relationship between perceived stress, self-efficacy and professional burnout. The participants were 546 call-takers and dispatchers from 14 public-safety answering point in Poland aged between 19 and 65 years. The Link Burnout Questionnaire, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, and an independent questionnaire were used to gather information. The method of path analysis was used. The study confirmed the existence of negative relationships between perceived stress (assessment of the current situation) and self-efficacy (a personal trait). Taking into account the moderating effect of latent variable: psychological comfort revealed a hidden relationship between stress and burnout. The stress-burnout relationship occurred only among participants with low level of psychological comfort, so it was not a proportional relationship. In the case of participants with a high level of second latent variable: power-to-affect, the hypothesis that a high level of this variable should weaken the relationship between stress and burnout was not confirmed. The level of latent variables did not affect the self-efficacy relationship with occupational burnout. Taking into account the differences in the intensity of latent variables showed their moderating effect, which often turned out to be different from the assumed one and obtained in the research of other authors. This allowed to discover the relationships that might otherwise have been overlooked and not included in burnout prevention.

Workplace wellness programmes can improve employee health and retain skilled workers. To broaden our understanding about ways to help doctors coping with mental health problems and to develop population-informed workplace wellness recommendations for physician populations. Researchers surveyed physicians to document potential warning signs and prevention strategies. A survey was issued to doctors who presented to a physician health programme with mental health complaints. The survey captured respondents' feedback about how to identify and prevent mental health problems. Data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. There were 185 participants. Half of respondents believed their problems could have been recognized sooner and 60% said they exhibited signs that could aid in earlier detection. Potential warnings included fluctuations in mood (67%), increased comments about stress/burnout (49%) and behavioural changes (32%). To improve detection, prevention and care-seeking for mental health problems, doctors endorsed multiple items related to the use of interpersonal supports, personal factors and organizational dynamics throughout the survey. The findings confirmed earlier work demonstrating the value of social and organizational support in maintaining physician health. It further indicated that earlier identification and/or prevention of mental health problems is not only possible, but that medical organizations are uniquely situated to carry out this work.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Health Promotionmethodsstandards', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screeningmethodsstandards', 'Mental Disordersdiagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Healthstandardsstatistics & numerical data', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Carepsychology', 'Physicianspsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Workplacepsychologystandards']",[],Journal Article
32746817,Developing an animal-assisted support program for healthcare employees.,"Employee burnout and its associated consequences is a significant problem in the healthcare workforce. Workplace animal therapy programs offer a potential strategy for improving employee well-being; however, research on animal therapy programs for healthcare workers is lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of an animal-assisted support program to improve healthcare employee well-being. In this mixed-methods pilot intervention study, we implemented an animal-assisted support program in a multidisciplinary healthcare clinic at a large VA hospital. The program included 20 sessions over 3 months, each approximately 1-h long. Real-time mood data were collected from participants immediately before and after each session. Participation rates were tracked in real time and self-reported at follow-up. Data on burnout and employee perceptions of the program were collected upon completion via a survey and semi-structured interviews. Differences in mood and burnout pre/post program participation were assessed with t-tests. Participation was high; about 51% of clinic employees (n = 39) participated in any given session, averaging participation in 9/20 sessions. Mood (on a scale of 1 = worst to 5 = best mood) significantly improved from immediately before employees interacted with therapy dogs (M = 2.9) to immediately after (M = 4.5) (p = 0.000). Employees reported significantly lower levels of patient-related burnout (e.g., how much exhaustion at work relates to interaction with patients) after (M = 18.0 vs. before, M = 40.0) participating (p = 0.002). Qualitative findings suggested that employees were highly satisfied with the program, noticed an improved clinic atmosphere, and experienced a reduction in stress and boost in mood. Establishing an animal-assisted support program for employees in a busy healthcare clinic is feasible and acceptable. Our pilot data suggest that animal-assisted programs could be a means to boost mood and decrease facets of burnout among healthcare employees.","['Animal Assisted Therapyorganization & administration', 'Animals', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Dogs', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Qualitative Research', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['Animal therapy', 'Employee burnout', 'Employee wellness', 'Healthcare workers', 'Organizational behavior']",Journal Article
27310426,Burnout Subtypes and Absence of Self-Compassion in Primary Healthcare Professionals: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Primary healthcare professionals report high levels of distress and burnout. A new model of burnout has been developed to differentiate three clinical subtypes: 'frenetic', 'underchallenged' and 'worn-out'. The aim of this study was to confirm the validity and reliability of the burnout subtype model in Spanish primary healthcare professionals, and to assess the explanatory power of the self-compassion construct as a possible protective factor. The study employed a cross-sectional design. A sample of n = 440 Spanish primary healthcare professionals (214 general practitioners, 184 nurses, 42 medical residents) completed the Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ-36), the Maslach Burnout Inventory General Survey (MBI-GS), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The factor structure of the BCSQ-36 was estimated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by the unweighted least squares method from polychoric correlations. Internal consistency (R) was assessed by squaring the correlation between the latent true variable and the observed variables. The relationships between the BCSQ-36 and the other constructs were analysed using Spearman's r and multiple linear regression models. The structure of the BCSQ-36 fit the data well, with adequate CFA indices for all the burnout subtypes. Reliability was adequate for all the scales and sub-scales (R≥0.75). Self-judgement was the self-compassion factor that explained the frenetic subtype (Beta = 0.36; p<0.001); isolation explained the underchallenged (Beta = 0.16; p = 0.010); and over-identification the worn-out (Beta = 0.25; p = 0.001). Other significant associations were observed between the different burnout subtypes and the dimensions of the MBI-GS, UWES and PANAS. The typological definition of burnout through the BCSQ-36 showed good structure and appropriate internal consistence in Spanish primary healthcare professionals. The negative self-compassion dimensions seem to play a relevant role in explaining the burnout profiles in this population, and they should be considered when designing specific treatments and interventions tailored to the specific vulnerability of each subtype.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Altruism', 'Burnout, Professionalclassificationphysiopathologyprevention & control', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Empathy', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Psychological', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Physicians, Primary Carepsychology', 'Primary Health Care', 'Spain', 'Stress, Psychologicalphysiopathologyprevention & control', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Workforce']",[],Journal Article
31799151,Medical student depression and its correlates across three international medical schools.,"Medical students have high rates of depression, anxiety, and burnout that have been found to affect their empathy, professional behaviors, and performance as a physician. While studies have examined predictors for burnout and depression in the United States (US), no study, to our knowledge, has compared depression in medical students cross-culturally, or has attempted to examine the effect of factors influencing rates including burnout, exercise, stress, unmet mental health needs, and region. To examine rates of depression in three international cohorts of medical students, and determine variables that may explain these differences. Convenience samples of medical students from three countries (US, China, and a Middle Eastern country whose name remains anonymous per request from the school) were surveyed in this observational study. Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and a modified Maslach Burnout Inventory, depression and burnout were examined among medical students from the three cohorts (n = 473). Chi-square test and analysis of variance were used to examine differences in demographics, behavioral, and psychological variables across these three schools to identify potentially confounding descriptive characteristics. Analysis of covariance compared depression and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout identified through Principal Component Analysis across countries. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the impact of demographic, behavioral, and psychological variables on screening positive for depression. Medical students from the Middle Eastern country had the highest rates of positive depression screens (41.1%), defined as a PHQ-2 score of ≥ 3, followed by China (14.1 %), and then the US (3.8%). More students in the Middle Eastern school had unmet mental health needs (50.8%) than at the medical school in China (34.8%) or the school in the US (32.8%) (Pearson chi-square significance < 0.05). Thus, PHQ-2 scores were adjusted for unmet mental health needs; however, the Middle Eastern country continued to have the highest depression. Adjusting for PHQ-2 score, medical students from the US scored the highest on emotional exhaustion (a measure of burnout). Demographic variables did not significantly predict medical student depression; however, lack of exercise, unmet mental health needs, stress, and emotional exhaustion predicted nearly half of depression in these cohorts. In comparison to the US, coming from the Middle Eastern country and China predicted higher levels of depression. Depression rates differ in three international cohorts of medical students. Measured factors contributed to some observed differences. Identifying site-specific prevention and intervention strategies in medical student mental health is warranted.",[],"['Burnout', 'Depression', 'International', 'Medical students', 'Wellness']",Journal Article
26655203,Mental health symptoms identify workers at risk of long-term sickness absence due to mental disorders: prospective cohort study with 2-year follow-up.,"Mental health problems are a leading cause of long-term sickness absence (LTSA). Workers at risk of mental LTSA should preferably be identified before they report sick. The objective of this study was to examine mental health symptoms as predictors of future mental LTSA in non-sicklisted workers. Prospective cohort study of 4877 non-sicklisted postal workers. Mental health symptoms were measured at baseline in November 2010 with the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (distress and depressed mood) and Maslach's Burnout Inventory (fatigue). Mental health symptom scores were analyzed against incident mental LTSA retrieved from an occupational health register in 2011 and 2012. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) represented the ability of mental health symptom scores to discriminate between workers with and without mental LTSA during 2-year follow-up. Complete cases analysis included 2782 (57 %) postal workers of whom 73 had mental LTSA during 2-year follow-up. Distress fairly (AUC = 0.75; 95 % CI 0.67-0.82) and both depressed mood (AUC = 0.64; 95 % CI 0.57-0.72) and fatigue (AUC = 0.61; 95 % CI 0.53-0.69) poorly discriminated between workers with and without mental LTSA during 2-year follow-up. The discriminative ability of distress did not improve by adding depressed mood and fatigue. Measurement of distress sufficed to identify non-sicklisted postal workers at risk of future mental LTSA. The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire distress scale is a promising tool to screen working populations for of mental LTSA, which enables secondary preventive strategies.","['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depression', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Health', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Sick Leavestatistics & numerical data', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",[],Journal Article
25503892,"Effects of work burden, job strain and support on depressive symptoms and burnout among Japanese physicians.","Days off, on call, night duty, working hours and job stress can affect physicians' mental health, and support from supervisors and co-workers may have a buffering effect. This study elucidates whether job strain and job factors affect physicians' mental health, and whether support from supervisors and co-workers has a protective effect on their mental health. The subjects included 494 physicians. The Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) was used to evaluate job demand, job control and support. High job strain was defined as a combination of high job demand and low job control. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey was used to evaluate burnout. Possible confounder adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to obtain odds ratios for depressive symptoms and burnout. As per the analysis, high job strain had significantly higher odds ratios, and support from co-workers had significant protective odds ratios for depressive symptoms. High job strain and having only 2-4 days off per month (compared to > 8 days off per month) had significantly higher odds ratios, and support from co-workers had significant protective odds ratios for burnout. High job strain was related to depressive symptoms and burnout, and support from co-workers had a buffering effect on depressive symptoms and burnout. An inadequate number of days off was related to burnout. Assessment of job strain may be a good tool to measure physicians' mental health, and a sufficient number of days off may be needed to prevent burnout.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionaletiology', 'Depressionetiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physicianspsychology', 'Social Support', 'Stress, Psychologicalpsychology', 'Time Factors', 'Work Schedule Tolerancepsychology', 'Workloadpsychology']",[],Journal Article
29546855,A Novel Framework Based on the Improved Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model to Understand the Impact of Job Characteristics on Job Burnout from the View of Emotion Regulation Theory.,"It has been suggested that individual job characteristics have a significant impact on job burnout, and the process is subject to the regulation of demographic variables. However, the influence path of job characteristics on job burnout is still a ""black box"". On the basis of a systematic literature review by employing Pub Med, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CNKI and Scopus for required information with the several keywords ""Job burnout"", ""Emotion regulation"", ""Personality traits"", and ""Psychological stress"", in this study, an improved mine rescue workers-oriented job demands-resources (JD-R) model was put forward. Then, a novel analysis framework, to explore the impact of job characteristics on job burnout from the view of emotion regulation theory, was proposed combining the personality trait theory. This study argues that job burnout is influenced by job demands through expressive suppression and by job resources through cognitive reappraisal respectively. Further more, job demands and job resources have the opposite effects on job burnout through the ""loss-path"" caused by job pressure and the ""gain-path"" arised from job motivation, respectively. Extrovert personality traits can affect the way the individual processes the information of work environment and then how individual further adopts emotion regulation strategies, finally resulting in indirectly affecting the influence path of mine rescue workers' job characteristics on job burnout. This present study can help managers to realize the importance of employees' psychological stress and job burnout problems. The obtained conclusions provide significant decision-making references for managers in intervening job burnout, managing emotional stress and mental health of employees.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & controlpsychology', 'Character', 'Emotional Adjustment', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Job Description', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Models, Psychological', 'Occupational Stresspsychology', 'Personnel Management', 'Workloadpsychology', 'Young Adult']",[],Review
28461539,Factors Affecting Resilience and Development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Critical Care Nurses.,"Job stress and cumulative exposure to traumatic events experienced by critical care nurses can lead to psychological distress and the development of burnout syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder. Resilience can mitigate symptoms associated with these conditions. To identify factors that affect resilience and to determine if the factors have direct or indirect effects on resilience in development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Data from 744 respondents to a survey mailed to 3500 critical care nurses who were members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses were analyzed. Mplus was used to analyze a mediation model. Nurses who worked in any type of intensive care unit other than the medical unit and had high scores for resilience were 18% to 50% less likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder than were nurses with low scores. Nurses with a graduate degree in nursing were 18% more likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder than were nurses with a bachelor's degree. Because of their effects on resilience, working in a medical intensive care unit and having a graduate degree may influence the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. Future research is needed to better understand the impact of resilience on health care organizations, development of preventive therapies and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder for critical care nurses, and the most appropriate mechanism to disseminate and implement strategies to address posttraumatic stress disorder.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology', 'Critical Care Nursing', 'Educational Status', 'Familypsychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nursing Staff, Hospitalpsychology', 'Resilience, Psychological', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumaticpsychology', 'Time Factors']",[],Journal Article
28806863,"Influence of gender, working field and psychosocial factors on the vulnerability for burnout in mental hospital staff: results of an Austrian cross-sectional study.","According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU-OSHA), hospitals represent a work environment with high job strain. Prolonged perceived occupational stress may result in symptoms of burnout, such as emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP) and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). Understanding which factors may reduce vulnerability for burnout is an important requirement for well-targeted occupational stress prevention in mental hospital staff. To identify the influence of gender, age, working field, family structure, education, voluntarily occupational training during holidays and length of stay on job on occupational stress perception. In a cross-sectional design, 491 employees (311 female, 180 male) of an Austrian mental health centre participated in the study. The extent of perceived occupational stress was assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) with the scales for emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment. Participants were divided according to their working field in those working with/without patients. Prevalence of emotional exhaustion was higher in women working with patients compared to men working with patients (25% vs. 18%, p = 0.003). Age above 45 years was significantly associated with decreased vulnerability for burnout in men (EE p = 0.040, DP p = 0.010, PA p = 0.007), but not in women. A lower level of education had a significant impact on depersonalisation in both sexes (p = 0.001 for men, p = 0.048 for women). Length of stay on job showed a significant influence on emotional exhaustion. No significant relationship was found between family structure and vulnerability for burnout. Gender had a differential effect on perceived occupational stress indicating a need for gender-tailored preventive strategies. Age, working field, education, voluntarily occupational training during holidays and length of stay on job affect vulnerability for burnout in mental hospital staff.","['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Austria', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, Psychiatricstatistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Stressprevention & control', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['Maslach Burnout Inventory', 'burnout', 'gender', 'mental hospital staff', 'occupational stress']",Journal Article
31427467,"Mental well-being, job satisfaction and self-rated workability in general practitioners and hospitalisations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions among listed patients: a cohort study combining survey data on GPs and register data on patients.","Physicians' work conditions and mental well-being may affect healthcare quality and efficacy. Yet the effects on objective measures of healthcare performance remain understudied. This study examined mental well-being, job satisfaction and self-rated workability in general practitioners (GPs) in relation to hospitalisations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC-Hs), a register-based quality indicator affected by referral threshold and prevention efforts in primary care. This is an observational study combining data from national registers and a nationwide questionnaire survey among Danish GPs. To ensure precise linkage of each patient with a specific GP, partnership practices were not included. Study cases were 461 376 adult patients listed with 392 GPs. Associations between hospitalisations in the 6-month study period and selected well-being indicators were estimated at the individual patient level and adjusted for GP gender and seniority, list size, and patient factors (comorbidity, sociodemographic characteristics). The median number of ACSC-Hs per 1000 listed patients was 10.2 (interquartile interval: 7.0-13.7). All well-being indicators were inversely associated with ACSC-Hs, except for perceived stress (not associated). The adjusted incidence rate ratio was 1.26 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.42) for patients listed with GPs in the least favourable category of self-rated workability, and 1.19 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.35), 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.27) and 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27) for patients listed with GPs in the least favourable categories of burn-out, job satisfaction and general well-being (the most favourable categories used as reference). Hospitalisations for conditions not classified as ambulatory care sensitive were not equally associated. ACSC-H frequency increased with decreasing levels of GP mental well-being, job satisfaction and self-rated workability. These findings imply that GPs' work conditions and mental well-being may have important implications for individual patients and for healthcare expenditures.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Ambulatory Carestatistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmarkepidemiology', 'General Practitionerspsychology', 'Hospitalizationstatistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Stressepidemiology', 'Physician-Patient Relations', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['ambulatory care', 'general practice', 'human factors', 'primary care', 'quality improvement']",Journal Article
34334303,A year in review: sleep dysfunction and psychological distress in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The Covid-19 outbreak has taken a substantial toll on the mental and physical wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs), impacting healthcare systems at a global scale. One year into the pandemic, the need to establish the prevalence of sleep dysfunction and psychological distress in the face of COVID-19, identify risk and protective factors and explore effective countermeasures remains of critical importance. Despite implicit limitations relating to the quality of available studies, a plethora of evidence to-date suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience significant sleep disturbances (estimated to afflict every two in five HCWs) as well as mood symptoms (with more than one in five reporting high levels of depression or anxiety). Younger age, female gender, frontline status, fear or risk of infection, occupation, current or past mental health concerns, and a lower level of social support were all associated with a greater risk of disturbed sleep and adverse psychological outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the link between sleep deprivation, susceptibility to viral infections and psychosocial wellbeing, in relevance to COVID-19 and summarize the existing evidence regarding the presence and predictors of traumatic stress/PTSD and burnout in HCWs. Finally, we highlight the role of resilience and tailored interventions in order to mitigate vulnerability and prevent long-term physical and psychological implications. Indeed, promoting psychological resilience through an enhanced social support network has proven crucial for HCWs in coping under these strenuous circumstances. Future research should aim to provide high quality information on the long-term consequences and the effectiveness of applied interventions.","['Anxietyepidemiology', 'COVID-19', 'Depressionepidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', 'Psychological Distress', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Wake Disordersepidemiology']","['Burnout', 'COVID-19', 'Healthcare workers', 'Mental health', 'PTSD', 'Sleep dysfunction']",Journal Article

35853335,Compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction among Chinese midwives working in the delivery room: A cross-sectional survey.,"Compassion fatigue can negatively affect not only healthcare professionals' physical and mental health but also the quality of care they provide and organizational outcomes. However, little is known about compassion fatigue among Chinese midwives working in the delivery room. This study aimed to examine compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction levels among Chinese midwives working in the delivery room and correlate their compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction. A multisite cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling approach was conducted at 62 hospitals in Henan Province, central China, from May to July 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey. A self-designed sociodemographic and work-related data sheet, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) were used to measure the participants'basic information, level of social support, compassion fatigue(consists of burnout and secondary traumatic stress) and compassion satisfaction. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the characteristics of the participants' social support, compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to identify associations with the participants' sociodemographic and professional characteristics, compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction. A total of 213 questionnaires were completed, 206 of which were valid (96.71%). The majority of the participants reported moderate risks for compassion satisfaction (75.24%) and burnout (59.71%) and low risks for secondary traumatic stress (61.65%). Higher job satisfaction as a midwife, lower average working hours per week in the past year, higher social support, extroverted personality, and work recognition in the past month were positively associated with compassion satisfaction, explaining 48.7% of the total variance. Always considering giving up a midwifery career, lower social support, working a day-night shift, poor health condition, more exposure to traumatic birth events per month on average in recent years, and lower job satisfaction as a midwife were negative factors for burnout, explaining 35.3% of the total variance. Four factors, including more exposure to traumatic birth events per month on average in recent years, always considering giving up a midwifery career, working a day-night shift and poor sleep quality, were negatively related to secondary traumatic stress, explaining 14.2% of the variance. In this study, midwives showed moderate levels of compassion satisfaction and burnout and low levels of secondary traumatic stress which should attract the attention of health institutions. A healthy and supportive work environment is crucial to midwives' health, well-being and job satisfaction.

36498390,Burnout Syndrome and COVID-19 Lockdown: Research on Residential Care Workers Who Assume Parental Roles with Youths.,"Healthcare professionals are at higher risk of developing and experiencing burnout. Parents may also suffer from prolonged stressful conditions that lead to physical and emotional exhaustion. Residential youth care workers assume a caregiving role that can lead to persistent stressful conditions that affect their relationship with the youth. In addition, the COVID-19 lockdown has had a negative impact on both the organization and the work, as well as on the lifestyle of workers and minors. In fact, during the pandemic, contact with families was not possible due to restrictions and this increased the need for caregivers to assume a parental role. This research aims to examine the risk of burnout in a sample of 75 healthcare professionals working with youths and the association with psychological traits. Then, we aim to evaluate these aspects during the COVID-19 lockdown The measurements, conducted in both February 2019 and April 2021, included six questionnaires: MBI to assess burnout, TAS_20 to explore alexithymic traits, COPE_NVI to assess coping strategies, FDS_R to quantify frustration intolerance at work, IRI for empathy, and FFMQ to investigate awareness and emotional regulation. Our sample shows a medium-high risk of developing burnout, which worsened during the pandemic. A worsening of emotional skills, paralleled by a greater empathic investment required by the emergency situation, and an assumed parental role is observable. Coping strategies correlate with burnout risk, as avoidance strategies were strongly associated with emotional exhaustion. These findings suggest an urgent need to develop targeted and timely interventions for healthcare professionals in order to prevent long-term consequences.","['Humans', 'Adolescent', 'COVID-19epidemiology', 'Communicable Disease Control', 'Burnout, Psychologicalepidemiology', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Pandemics', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology']","['COVID-19', 'burnout syndrome', 'health care professionals', 'parental burnout', 'youths']",Journal Article

Among these, cosmonauts routinely experience extreme conditions due to microgravity, space radiation, altered oxygen supply, physical and mental fatigue during training, spaceflight, and post-flight. Long route aviation pilots display elevated oncogenic risk, connected with cosmic radiation overexposure, and high mortality rates for cardiovascular causes. Engine drivers, like pilots, are affected by health consequences of psycho-emotional stress, and burnout syndrome. The free radical (FR)/antioxidant (AO) imbalance is a common feature in all these pathological conditions. To assess the effective relevance of oxidative stress, we analyzed blood and urine reliable markers of FR production and AO defenses in 12 Russian cosmonauts, 55 airline pilots, 63 train engine drivers, and 50 age-matched controls by measuring the following: (a) lipophilic/hydrophilic low-molecular weight AO and AO enzyme activities, (b) nitric oxide, superoxide anion, hydroperoxide production, and (c) urinary catecholamine/serotonine metabolites and lipoperoxidation markers. Cosmonauts showed elevated granulocyte superoxide and nitric oxide production, increased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione oxidation, and drastically decreased plasma/leucocyte lipophilic AO levels (P < 0.001-0.01). Aviation pilots, like train drivers, displayed a mild but constant oxidative stress, more pronounced in intercontinental routes pilots, and consistent with lymphocyte chromosomal alterations, DNA oxidation, and cardiovascular malfunction.

To compare patterns of potential moral injury (PMI) between post-9/11 military combat veterans and healthcare workers (HCWs) surveyed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional surveys of veterans (2015-2019) and HCWs (2020-2021) in the USA. 618 military veterans who were deployed to a combat zone after September 11, 2001, and 2099 HCWs working in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other-induced PMI (disturbed by others' immoral acts) and self-induced PMI (disturbed by having violated own morals) were the primary outcomes. Sociodemographic variables, combat/COVID-19 experience, depression, quality of life, and burnout were measured as correlates. 46.1% of post-9/11 veterans and 50.7% of HCWs endorsed other-induced PMI, whereas 24.1% of post-9/11 veterans and 18.2% of HCWs endorsed self-induced PMI. Different types of PMI were significantly associated with gender, race, enlisted vs. officer status, and post-battle traumatic experiences among veterans and with age, race, working in a high COVID-19-risk setting, and reported COVID-19 exposure among HCWs. Endorsing either type of PMI was associated with significantly higher depressive symptoms and worse quality of life in both samples and higher burnout among HCWs. The potential for moral injury is relatively high among combat veterans and COVID-19 HCWs, with deleterious consequences for mental health and burnout. Demographic characteristics suggestive of less social empowerment may increase risk for moral injury. Longitudinal research among COVID-19 HCWs is needed.

This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores; anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology', 'COVID-19', 'Female', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Psychometrics', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Turkey']",[],Journal Article
33933050,Exploring wellbeing in first year medical students amidst a curriculum change.,"The support of student wellbeing features highly in all higher education institutional agendas. For medical students good physical and mental health can help prevent burnout, equip students for their future healthcare setting and indirectly improve patient care. At the University of Nottingham (UK), we were keen to explore undergraduate medical students perceived wellbeing before, during, and after an early years' (years 1-3) curriculum change. A restructure of the curriculum enabled personal wellbeing sessions to be embedded and directly linked to the pastoral support system. Students' perceived wellbeing was assessed through a questionnaire distributed to three cohorts of first year students at the start and end of the autumn semester. The data showed a clear improvement of perceived physical health at the end of the first semester following the curriculum change, alongside increased mood and ability to relax. A surprising outcome of this study was that students reported increased stress levels at the end of the semester, which we believe may be attributed to the change in assessment within the new curriculum. Our medical students are now facing end of year summative examinations, but are acutely aware of their progress as they undertake frequent formative assessments during the year. We propose that comparison of performance with peers is having a direct impact on perceived stress in these cohorts. The study has shown that embedding wellbeing in the curriculum can have positive effects even within a changing curriculum. The importance of evolving wellbeing provision and support based on the needs of the student population is essential and probably never more in need than at this moment in time.","['Burnout, Professionalepidemiologyprevention & control', 'Curriculum', 'Education, Medical, Undergraduate', 'Humans', 'Mental Health', 'Students, Medical', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['Curriculum change', 'Undergraduate medical students', 'Wellbeing']",Journal Article

This study aimed to determine the level of occupational stress in coal miners and to assess the associations between occupational stress and job burn-out, depression and hypertension. The results could provide clues for preventive measures and strategies to improve the psychological well-being of this population. Cross-sectional study. Xinjiang Coal Administration Bureau. Four coal mines were selected randomly (computer-generated random number-based selection process) from the 21 coal mines of Xinjiang, and all miners with >1 year of employment were screened for participation. A general demographic questionnaire, the Self-rating Depression Scale, the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model and the Maslach Burn-out Inventory. A total of 1400 questionnaires were collected, including 1334 (95.3%) valid questionnaires. This survey indicated that 1107 (83.0%) participants with an ERI score >1 (high occupational stress) and 227 (12.8%) had ERI ≤1. Severe depression was found in 21.7% of the participants. Job burn-out was positively correlated with occupational stress, which was, in turn, associated with depression. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that depression (β=0.006, p=0.012), sex (β=0.358, p<0.001) and occupational stress (β=0.702, p<0.001) were independently associated with job burn-out. Working years (β=-0.086, p=0.015) and job burn-out (β=0.022, p<0.001) were directly associated with depression. This study highlights that occupational stress may affect job burn-out, depression symptoms and hypertension. A higher degree of occupational stress was associated with poorer mental status and hypertension.","['Chinaepidemiology', 'Coal', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depressionepidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypertensionepidemiology', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Occupational Stresscomplicationsepidemiology', 'Reward', 'Stress, Psychologicalcomplicationsepidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']","['occupational & industrial medicine', 'public health']",Journal Article
35027938,The Effect of Inner Engineering Online (IEO) Program on Reducing Stress for Information Technology Professionals: A Randomized Control Study.,"In recent years, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are rapidly growing in the workplace. Several meta-analyses conclude that overall MBIs have a moderate effect of alleviating deficit-based experiences, such as burnout and stress, but a small to no effect of promoting asset-based experiences, such as positive affect and well-being. While workplace MBIs vary greatly in their content, format, and duration, the dominant format is still face to face in a group setting, which limits scalability. Our study introduces an emerging workplace intervention called Inner Engineering Online (IEO) and evaluates its effect on reducing stress, burnout, depression, and anxiety and increasing mindfulness and joy. Drawing on the classical yogic science, IEO is a comprehensive web-based multicomponent intervention that utilizes dialectic discourse, meditation, and yogic practices designed to improve physical, mental, and emotional health. Utilizing a randomized active control cross-over experimental design with a sample of 71 employees of an Information Technology company, we tested our hypothesis that IEO training and regular daily yogic practice are likely to lower the stress levels, prevent burnout, and alleviate anxiety and depression, while at the same time promotes positive affect for employees. The results show that IEO program significantly reduces stress only among those who adhere to recommended daily yogic practices. The study is limited by its small sample size. Future research using a large sample is recommended to reexamine the effect of IEO training on occupational health. This trial is registered with NCT04126564.",[],[],Journal Article
26285404,Characteristics of the nurse manager's recognition behavior and its relation to sense of coherence of staff nurses in Japan.,"The recognition behaviors strongly influence the job satisfaction of staff nurses and an extremely important factor for the prevention of burnout and the promotion of retention. Additionally, among internal factors that may affect worker's mental health, a sense of coherence (SOC) is an important concept from the view of the salutogenic theory and stress recognition style. Individual's SOC increases in relation to recognition behavior. However, in Japan, few studies have examined the effect of recognition behaviors on the SOC of staff nurses. The purpose of this study was to investigate how staff nurses perceive recognition behaviors of the nurse manager and to determine the relationship between recognition behaviors and the staff nurses' SOC. This quantitative, cross-sectional study involved 10 hospitals in Japan. A total of 1425 nurses completed the questionnaire. As a result, the perceptions of nurse manager's recognition behaviors by staff nurses were evaluated by presentation and report, individual value and the transfer of responsibility, and professional development. The median score of staff nurse SOC-13 was 50 (IQR; 45-55). Significant differences in SOC scores were found in marital status, age, years of experience, and mental and physical health condition. In conclusion, recognition behaviors by the nurse manager can improve staff nurse's SOC and effectively support the mental health of the staff nurse.","['Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Leadership', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nurse Administratorspsychology', 'Nursing Staff, Hospitalpsychology', 'Sense of Coherence', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",[],Journal Article
15660594,Relaxation training methods for nurse managers in Hong Kong: a controlled study.,"Nurse managers are under increased stress because of excessive workloads and hospitals' restructuring which is affecting their work tasks. High levels of stress could affect their mental health. Yet, few stress management training programmes are provided for this population. The purpose of this study was to apply stretch-release relaxation and cognitive relaxation training to enhance the mental health for nurse managers. A total of 65 nurse managers in Hong Kong were randomly assigned to stretch-release relaxation (n = 17), cognitive relaxation (n = 18), and a test control group (n = 35). Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Chinese version of the General Health Questionnaire. Participants were assessed at the pretreatment session, the fourth posttreatment session, and at the 1-month follow-up session. The results revealed both the stretch-release and cognitive relaxation training enhanced mental health in nurse managers in Hong Kong. The application of relaxation training in enhancing mental health status for nurses and health professionals is discussed.","['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Imagery, Psychotherapy', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Nurse Administratorspsychology', 'Relaxation Therapy']",[],Randomized Controlled Trial
23577617,Is Mindful Reflective Practice the way forward to reduce medication errors?,"Medication errors can seriously affect patients and healthcare professionals. In over 60% of cases, medication errors are associated with one or more contributory; individual factors including staff being forgetful, stressed, tired or engaged in multiple tasks simultaneously, often alongside being distracted or interrupted. Routinised hospital practice can lead professionals to work in a state of mindlessness, where it is easy to be unaware of how both body and mind are functioning. Mindfulness, defined as moment-to-moment awareness of the everyday experience, could represent a useful strategy to improve reflection in pharmacy practice. The importance of reflection to reduce diagnostic errors in medicine has been supported in the literature; however, in pharmaceutical care, reflection has also only been discussed to a limited extent. There is expanding evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness in the treatment of many mental and physical health problems in the general population, as well as its role in enhancing decision making, empathy and reducing burnout or fatigue in medical staff. Considering the benefits of mindfulness, the authors suggest that healthcare professionals should be encouraged to develop their practice of mindfulness. This would not only be beneficial in relieving stress, increasing attention levels and awareness, but it is believed that the integration of mindfulness and reflective practice in a 'Mindful Reflective Practice' could minimise some of the individual factors that lead to medication errors. Mindfulness Reflective Practice could therefore represent an important element in pre-registration education and continual professional development for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.","['Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Medication Errorsprevention & controlpsychology', 'Mindfulness', 'Pharmacistspsychology']","['clinical practice', 'patient safety', 'prescribing errors']",Journal Article
23294686,Qigong and mindfulness-based mood recovery: exercise experiences from a single case.,"Sara, the participant in this single case study, had to leave work due to burnout. She is now recovered and working, but still complains of disturbed moods and worries about getting burned out again. The aim of this study was to, by way of Qigong and mindfulness exercise, increase the participant's positive mood to a functional level and to increase exercise experiences by combining mindfulness and Qigong practice. The professional practice intervention was planned to last twelve weeks, combining mindfulness practice and three different Qigong exercise techniques. Exercise behavior was noted daily, stress-energy and wellness were followed up weekly, and mindfulness was followed up after four, nine and 12 weeks. Sara feels that her moods (more energy, wellness and joy, as well as less stress and worry) have stabilized at a high level (good to very good), and her mindfulness score also improved to a high level (4.2 on a six-point scale). Sara also states that she enjoys life more: accepts stressful situations as they are, is less worried about becoming burned out again, and is more open to life. Exercise professionals may use mindfulness practice and Qigong exercise when recovering moods, probably even better in preventing burnout syndromes.","['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Anxietyphysiopathologyrehabilitation', 'Breathing Exercises', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychologyrehabilitation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Meditation', 'Mental Healingpsychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mood Disordersphysiopathologyrehabilitation', 'Occupational Diseasesphysiopathologyrehabilitation', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Workplace']",[],Journal Article
28608232,Emotional Distress Among Physician Residents and Fellows: An Observational Study of Trainees Seeking Counseling Visits.,"Emotional distress, burnout, and depression occur frequently among graduate medical education (GME) trainees and may negatively affect patient care, education, and well-being. The authors aimed to characterize the causes and severity of distress among GME trainees seeking on-site counseling services at a large, multi-site, university-based training program in the USA. The authors analyzed visits of all GME trainees seeking counseling from 2009 to 2012 and described trainee characteristics, level of distress, chief and secondary complaints, and initial visit outcomes. GME trainees (n = 332; 14.1% of total population) attended 2017 counseling visits. Women comprised over half (60.7%) of the clients. Referrals originated from trainees themselves (79.8%), program leadership (16.6%), or partners (1.8%). Mean counselor-assessed distress level at intake was 4.1 (range 1-5). Mental health was the most frequent concern (46.1%), particularly depression (19.3%) or anxiety (11.5%). Other chief complaints included personal relationship (28.6%), career (21.7%), and physical health concerns (2.7%). Counselors referred nearly a quarter (22.7%) of trainees to additional services such as psychiatry, primary care provider, or career mentor. Most trainees (75.3%) returned for ≥1 follow-up counseling visits. GME trainees seen in counseling report significant emotional distress from a broad range of sources. Further research should identify effective preventative and therapeutic interventions to reduce trainee emotional distress.","['Adult', 'Burnout, Professionalpsychology', 'Counselingstatistics & numerical data', 'Depressionpsychology', 'Education, Medical, Graduate', 'Fellowships and Scholarships', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Internship and Residency', 'Male', 'Mental Health Servicesstatistics & numerical data', 'Physicianspsychologystatistics & numerical data', 'Stress, Psychologicalpsychology']","['Counseling', 'Depression', 'Graduate physician trainees', 'Wellness']",Journal Article
31174502,The effectiveness of school-based skills-training programs promoting mental health in adolescents: a study protocol for a randomized controlled study.,"Adolescence is a period of elevated stress sensitivity, which places adolescents at increased risk of developing mental health problems such as burnout, depression, anxiety, and externalizing problems. Early intervention of psychological needs and low-threshold care addressing such needs may prevent this dysfunctional development. Schools may provide an important environment to identify and address psychological needs. The aim of this protocol is to describe the design of a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of low-threshold school-based skills-training programs promoting the mental health of adolescents and to examine moderators of the effectiveness. A Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of two school-based skills-training programs aiming to promote mental health by improving either skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills. A multi-informant (i.e., students, parents, and trainers) and multi-method (i.e., questionnaires and physiological measurements) approach will be used to assess program targets (skills to deal with performance anxiety or social skills), direct program outcomes (performance or social anxiety) and mental health outcomes (i.e., stress, internalizing and externalizing problems, self-esteem and well-being), as well as specific moderators (i.e., student, parent and program characteristics, social support, perfectionism, stressful life events, perceived parental pressure, positive parenting behavior, treatment alliance and program integrity). The current study will provide information on the effectiveness of school-based skills-training programs. It is of crucial importance that the school environment can provide students with effective, low-threshold intervention programs to promote adolescents' daily functioning and well-being and prevent the emergence of mental health problems that negatively affect school performance.

29759262,Focus on the Quadruple Aim: Development of a Resiliency Center to Promote Faculty and Staff Wellness Initiatives.,"A growing body of evidence highlights the need for wellness programs to support health care professionals. Although much of the existing literature centers on practicing physicians and physician trainees, there is growing awareness that these challenges are not unique to physicians and affect all members of the health care team. Traumatic and stressful events will always be a part of health care; how these events are addressed on a personal and team level is essential to the success of a health care system. A Resiliency Center was developed on the basis of the specific concerns and strengths of local stakeholders to support the well-being of employees at University of Utah Health. The initial approach to evaluating and supporting faculty wellness began concurrent with planning for the Resiliency Center in 2016. Stakeholders were brought together by leaders in Health Sciences to propose a Resiliency Center. Initial data gathering was performed with several survey tools, including the American Medical Association's Mini Z. The Resiliency Center, which is housed in the Office of Wellness and Integrative Health, is intended to serve as an overarching structure to help coordinate the faculty and staff wellness initiatives currently in existence and fill identified gaps. The four pillars of the Center are wellness initiatives, communication skills training, peer support, and an on-site Employee Assistance Program. The current focus is on program development and outreach, with plans to measure the impact of the Center.","['Burnout, Professionalprevention & control', 'Communication', 'Faculty, Medicalpsychology', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Mental Health Servicesorganization & administration', 'Occupational Health Servicesorganization & administration', 'Program Development', 'Resilience, Psychological', 'Social Support', 'Workplacepsychology']",[],Journal Article
34319877,Moderation of the Stressor-Strain Process in Interns by Heart Rate Variability Measured With a Wearable and Smartphone App: Within-Subject Design Using Continuous Monitoring.,"The emergence of smartphones and wearable sensor technologies enables easy and unobtrusive monitoring of physiological and psychological data related to an individual's resilience. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a promising biomarker for resilience based on between-subject population studies, but observational studies that apply a within-subject design and use wearable sensors in order to observe HRV in a naturalistic real-life context are needed. This study aims to explore whether resting HRV and total sleep time (TST) are indicative and predictive of the within-day accumulation of the negative consequences of stress and mental exhaustion. The tested hypotheses are that demands are positively associated with stress and resting HRV buffers against this association, stress is positively associated with mental exhaustion and resting HRV buffers against this association, stress negatively impacts subsequent-night TST, and previous-evening mental exhaustion negatively impacts resting HRV, while previous-night TST buffers against this association. In total, 26 interns used consumer-available wearables (Fitbit Charge 2 and Polar H7), a consumer-available smartphone app (Elite HRV), and an ecological momentary assessment smartphone app to collect resilience-related data on resting HRV, TST, and perceived demands, stress, and mental exhaustion on a daily basis for 15 weeks. Multiple linear regression analysis of within-subject standardized data collected on 2379 unique person-days showed that having a high resting HRV buffered against the positive association between demands and stress (hypothesis 1) and between stress and mental exhaustion (hypothesis 2). Stress did not affect TST (hypothesis 3). Finally, mental exhaustion negatively predicted resting HRV in the subsequent morning but TST did not buffer against this (hypothesis 4). To our knowledge, this study provides first evidence that having a low within-subject resting HRV may be both indicative and predictive of the short-term accumulation of the negative effects of stress and mental exhaustion, potentially forming a negative feedback loop. If these findings can be replicated and expanded upon in future studies, they may contribute to the development of automated resilience interventions that monitor daily resting HRV and aim to provide users with an early warning signal when a negative feedback loop forms, to prevent the negative impact of stress on long-term health outcomes.",[],"['burnout', 'digital health', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'heart rate variability', 'mobile phone', 'resilience', 'sensors', 'sleep', 'strain', 'stress', 'wearables']",Journal Article
37525618,Validating a Korean Version of the Single-Item Burnout Measure for Evaluating Burnout Among Doctors.,"It is essential to measure the effect of burnout on doctors because burnout can affect doctors' mental health as well as the functioning of medical practice. This study aims to validate a Korean version of the single-item burnout measure (SIBM), which was developed to quickly measure the level of burnout among doctors. Through an online survey, a self-report questionnaire was administered to 324 public health doctors in Korea. The Korean version of the SIBM was validated against the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) screening tool, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale. Pearson correlation coefficients and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to determine the association between the SIBM and other scales. ANOVA was additionally used to determine the associations between the subscales of the MBI-GS and those of the SIBM. The correlation coefficient between the SIBM and the MBI-GS, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS was positive (p<0.01), and the correlation coefficient between the SIBM and the VAX scale was not significant. Therefore, convergent and discriminant validity was verified. Exhaustion and cynicism, which were correlated with the SIBM, with r2=0.43 (p<0.01) and 0.48 (p<0.01), yielded R2 scores of 0.27 (p<0.01) and 0.20 (p<0.01) in ANOVA. The Korean version of the SIBM is an appropriate screening tool for burnout. It can be evaluated in a short time, thereby enhancing continuous follow-up observations and response rates to burnout.",[],"['Burnout', 'Korean doctors', 'Single item measurement', 'Validation']",Journal Article
12887633,Working with the psychological effects of trauma: consequences for mental health-care workers--a literature review.,"This literature review explores how interacting with seriously traumatized people has the potential to affect health-care workers. The review begins with an introduction to post-traumatic stress disorder as being one of the possible negative consequences of exposure to traumatic events. The report proceeds with examining the concepts of vicarious traumatization, secondary traumatic stress, traumatic countertransference, burnout and compassion fatigue, as potential adverse consequences for workers who strive to help people who are traumatized. The differences between these concepts are also discussed. The notion of compassion satisfaction is examined as findings have demonstrated that it is a protective factor which can be used as a buffer to prevent the aforementioned concepts. Conversely, findings have shown that a history of previous stressful life events in helpers is a potential risk factor. The review concludes with an overview of the concepts considered, but cautions against generalization of the findings owing to the dearth of longitudinal studies into the issues raised and also the lack of investigation into the many different types of trauma.","['Burnout, Professional', 'Countertransference', 'Health Personnelpsychology', 'Humans', 'Mental Health Services', 'Professional-Patient Relations', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumaticpsychologytherapy', 'Workforce']",[],Review
24960441,Psychosocial risk factors for hospitalisation and death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a prospective cohort study.,"Only a few smaller studies have addressed the effect of psychosocial factors on risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in spite of the potential for psychosocial stress to affect development of the disease through immunological and behavioural pathways. The aim of this study is to determine the relation between various psychosocial risk factors, individually and accumulated, and COPD hospitalisation and deaths. A total of 8728 women and men free of asthma and COPD participating in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, were asked comprehensive questions on major life events, work-related stress, social network, vital exhaustion, economic hardship, and sleep medication in 1991-1993 and followed in nationwide registers until 2009, with <2% loss to follow-up. During follow-up, 461 women and 352 men were hospitalized with or died from COPD. Major life events in adult life and vital exhaustion were both associated with a higher risk of COPD in an exposure-dependent manner, with high vital exhaustion being associated with a hazard ratio [HR] of 2.31 (95% CI 1.69-3.16) for women and 2.48 (1.69-3.64) for men. A higher risk of COPD was also found in participants who experienced economic hardship or had a dysfunctional social network. Furthermore, the accumulation of psychosocial risk factors was associated with a higher risk of COPD in both women (HR = 2.40, 1.78-3.22) and men (HR = 1.93, 1.33-2.80). Psychosocial vulnerability may be important to consider both in clinical practice and when planning future preventive strategies against COPD.","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burnout, Professionalcomplications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalizationstatistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Fatiguecomplications', 'Middle Aged', 'Poverty', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructiveetiologymortalitytherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Support', 'Stress, Psychologicalcomplications']","['clustering', 'life change events', 'social support', 'stress, psychological', 'vital exhaustion']",Journal Article

Caring in this environment can be complex, challenging and stressful for staff; this can affect the quality of care provided to residents, lead to staff strain and burnout, and increase sickness, absence and turnover rates. It is therefore important to find interventions to increase the wellbeing of staff that will not only benefit staff themselves but also residents and care providers. Mindfulness training is known to be effective in treating a variety of physical and mental health conditions. The study uses mixed methods centred on a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Thirty care homes in Wales are implementing a brief web-based mindfulness training course, starting in random sequence. Four to ten consenting staff from each facility undertake the course and complete validated questionnaires at baseline and after eight and 20 weeks. We shall also interview a stratified sample of ten trained staff and analyse the transcripts thematically. The primary outcome is stress; secondary outcomes include job satisfaction, attitudes towards residents and sickness absence rates. With increasing numbers of people living with dementia in care homes and causing stress in their carers, it is important to evaluate support strategies for staff.
